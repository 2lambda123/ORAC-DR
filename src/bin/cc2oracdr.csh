#  Name:
#     cc2oracdr.csh

#  Purpose:
#     Converts ClassicCam raw or archive data into a UKIRT-like named
#     files for use in ORAC-DR.

#  Language:
#     Unix C-shell

#  Invocation:
#     cc2oracdr.csh

#  Description:
#     This script processes all the ir*.FITS files in the current
#     working directory each forming an NDF suitable for use by the 
#     ORAC-DR imaging pipeline.
#
#     The NDFs are named cc<date>_<observation_number>.  The UT
#     date is determined from the headers, and is in the numerical
#     format yyyyddmm.  Observations which span UT midnight take the
#     UT date of the first observation of that night available.  The
#     observation numbers come from the order in which they are
#     processed.  They are a 5-digit integer with leading zeroes
#     counting from 1.  To avoid name clashes each night's data
#     must be in its own directory.
#
#     Three FITS headers are written in each NDF: the observation number
#     in OBSNUM, the group number in GRPNUM, and the number of offsets
#     (number of group members plus one).  The group number is equated
#     to the observation number when any of four main headers: object
#     name, filter, exposure time, quadrant---changes value.
#     The group number is unchanged until the next group is located.
#
#     The script reports the input FITS file as it is processed, and its
#     date and time.  It also reports the creation of each NDF and
#     each new group.

#  Notes:
#     The FITS to NDF conversion uses the default parameter values.

#  Tasks:
#     KAPPA: FITSMOD, NDFCOPY; CONVERT: FITS2NDF.

#  Deficiencies:
#     Doesn't use the time of observation to order the sequence numbers.
