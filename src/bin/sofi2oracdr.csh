#  Name:
#     sofi2oracdr.csh

#  Purpose:
#     Converts SOFI raw or archive data into a UKIRT-like named files
#     for use in ORAC-DR.

#  Language:
#     Unix C-shell

#  Invocation:
#     sofi2oracdr.csh

#  Description:
#     This script processes all the SOFI*.FITS files in the current
#     working directory each forming an NDF suitable for use by the
#     ORAC-DR imaging pipeline.
#
#     The NDFs are named sofi<date>_<observation_number>.  The UT
#     date is determined from the headers, and is in the numerical
#     format yyyyddmm.  Observations which span UT midnight take the
#     UT date of the first observation of that night available.  The
#     observation numbers come from the order in which they are
#     processed.  They are a 5-digit integer with leading zeroes
#     counting from 1.  While the script can handle data from different
#     nights, each with its own sequence of observation numbers, it's
#     recommended that you have one directory for each night's
#     observations.
#
#     Two FITS headers are written in each NDF: the observation number
#     in OBSNUM, and the group number in GRPNUM.  The latter is derived
#     form the HIERARCH.ESO.TPL.EXPNO header.  A group starts when this
#     header's value is 1, whereupon the group number is the observation
#     number.  The group number is unchanged until the next group is
#     located.
#
#     The script reports the input FITS file as it is processed, and its
#     date and time.  It also reports the creation of each NDF.

#  Notes:
#     The FITS to NDF conversion uses the default parameter values.

#  Tasks:
#     KAPPA: FITSMOD, NDFCOPY; CONVERT: FITS2NDF.

#  Deficiencies:
#     Doesn't use the time of observation to order the sequence numbers.
