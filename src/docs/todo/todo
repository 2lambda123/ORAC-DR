TODO Items for ORAC-DR

CORE:

 - Define instrument modules in external file
       [Done - ORAC::Inst::Defn]

 - Use Pod::Usage to print help information
       [Done]

 - Move recipe manipualation to ORAC::Recipe
       [Done]

 - Finish SUN/233
       [Done]

 - Write internals document
    [not recipe writer docs]

 - Make parser slightly cleverer such that a line with
    my $ORAC_STATUS;

   does not cause warnings about undef to be created when the error
   checking code is automatically added. Should also make sure that
   comments are recognised since

    # $ORAC_STATUS

    will generate an error with strict.

SCUBA:

 - Correct for wrong T_COLD and T_HOT in skydips taken 
   before ~April 2000
      [This is now done in SKYDIP task]
