TODO Items for ORAC-DR
----------------------

CORE:

 - Write internals document
    [not recipe writer docs]

 - Make parser slightly cleverer such that a line with
    my $ORAC_STATUS;

   does not cause warnings about undef to be created when the error
   checking code is automatically added. Should also make sure that
   comments are recognised since

    # $ORAC_STATUS

    will generate an error with strict.

 - Convert header translation code to use Astro::FITS::HdrTrans.

 - Better Programmers Guide with more tutorial content.

 - Access to user parameters on the command line, e.g.

     -user NUMBER=12 MOSAIC_METHOD=median

   ...and perhaps in customisation files.

 - Online documentation CGI to pick up relevant code depending
   on ORAC_INSTRUMENT.

 - Allow search paths for calibration files to permit generic files
   like the faint standards at the top level or in an
   oracdr_cal/general/ directory.  [Also have an ORAC_CAL_DIR
   definition to permit users to change one file such as a
   calibration's rules, without having to copy the whole calibration
   direcotry for the instrument.]

SPECTROSCOPY:

 - Implement "quad" reduction. In a standard OSSO sequence, the OS
   and SO form the sky-subtracted pairs, then these pairs are
   averaged together to form a quad, then quads are medianed together
   to form the group. [BC]

 - Do proper wavelength calibration, using arc spectrum and known
   wavelengths to apply an accurate wavelength scale instead of the
   current estimation from headers, including cross-correlation between
   calibration arc and arc to be calibrated.

 - Spectropolarimetry.

 - Improve documentation in SUN/236.

 - Cope with dithered beams (needed by ESO IR spectrographs). [MJC]

 - Calculate and optionally display signal to noise ratio plots. [PH, partly done]

 - Remove residual sky / instrumental DC offset from g* or _ss frames  [PH]
   as this cripples the beam finding and opt-extract routines if bad.
   Seems like this affects UIST and sometime cgs4 long exposures too.

IFU:

 - Hot pixel cleaning. [BC]

 - Fix POINT_SOURCE so it properly uses the optimal extraction
   profile from a standard star to do spectrum extraction.

IMAGING:

 - Fold in AUTOASTROM to do accurate astrometry.

 - Create a "JITTER_SELF_FLAT_MAP" recipe for creating a wide-area
   mosaic out of dithers taken at different locations.

 - Implement CCDPACK/DRIZZLE for mosaicking when appropriate
   (possibly only for IRIS2).

 - End-of-night photometry script.

 - Check necessity of ORAC_OBSERVATION_TYPE check in many primitives.

 - Add ORAC_KEEP test in primitives other than *_TIDY_ where
   intermediat files are removed.

 - Investigate Fourier methods for removal of fringing.

 - Add _APPLY_DISTORTION_CORRECTION_ to all pertinent recipes.

 - Rationalise imaging/_AVERAGE_DARKS_ to one general version. [MJC]

HETERODYNE:

 - Allow JCMT heterodyne observations to be reduced with ORAC-DR. [BC]

SCUBA:

UIST IFU:

 - Examine image reconstruction for IJ, short J, and long J grisms.

MICHELLE IMAGING:

 - Extended-source recipe for data taken at different nod angles
   and throws.
