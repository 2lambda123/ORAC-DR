TODO Items for ORAC-DR
----------------------

CORE:

 - Define instrument modules in external file

 - Use Pod::Usage to print help information

 - Move recipe manipualation to ORAC::Recipe

 - Finish SUN/233

 - Write internals document

 - Make parser slightly cleverer such that a line with
    my $ORAC_STATUS;

   does not cause warnings about undef to be created when the error
   checking code is automatically added. Should also make sure that
   comments are recognised since

    # $ORAC_STATUS

    will generate an error with strict.

SCUBA:

 - Correct for wrong T_COLD and T_HOT in skydips taken 
   before ~April 2000

 - Add map calibration primitive
