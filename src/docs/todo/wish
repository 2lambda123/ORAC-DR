Wish-list for ORAC-DR
---------------------

CORE:

 - Launching of monoliths on demand (using tied hash??)
    [Done]

 - Place rules under CVS control?
    [Done]

 - Allow option to allow multiple oracdr processes to share
   a single index file

 - PH - Allow passing of arguments to recipies from command
   line, so we can do away with the separate recipes for
   NOFLAT, NOSTD etc. Also this will allow for example NOBIAS
   and NOREADNOISE without introducing ridiculous numbers of
   recipe names to cover all combinations.
