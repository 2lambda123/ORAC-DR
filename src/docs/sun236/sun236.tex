\section{Introduction}

This document describes the spectroscopy recipes and primitives included with
\ORACDR. See \xref{SUN/230}{sun230}{} for general \ORACDR\ documentation and
\xref{SUN/232}{sun232}{} for information on \ORACDR\ imaging data reduction.

At this time (September 2002), \ORACDR's spectroscopy suite is designed
to reduce data from the UKIRT spectrometer suite: CGS4 and
MICHELLE. Support for UIST is imminent. The recipes and primitives
are written in such a way as to make the addition of new instruments
simple.

\section{Recipe and Primitive Architecture}

In general, an \ORACDR\ recipe is simply a list of primitives, which
are executed in turn on the data from each observation that is passed
through the pipeline. The primitives form building blocks, each
carrying out an atomic data reduction operation. Thus, the recipe is
readable, understandable and to some extent modifiable by someone not
familiar with the primitive internals -- for example an observer or
scientist reducing data and wishing to add or remove steps from the
data reduction process. The primitives themselves are implemented in
perl5 and are not designed to be usefully modifiable by a
non-programmer.

In actual fact, it has been found to be beneficial in many places to
take this abstraction one level deeper -- in the spectroscopy pipeline
many of the steps which we wish to denote in the recipe as a single
primitive are themselves too complex to be considered an atomic data
reduction operation, perhaps a good analogy is that be considered a
molecular operation, themselves implemented as a simple list of
primitives which carry out the true atomic operations. In some cases
there is simple logic, generally simple flow control switches, for
example ``if'' clauses at the molecular level, though this code is
simple and these molecular level primitives can be usefully modified
to add or remove steps by a typical astronomer.

\section{The Recipes}

Each recipe has an in-code documentation section, which documents the
recipe concerned. Here, we simply divide the recipes into groups
corresponding to the type of observations they reduce, and give the
recipe documentation.

Some of the recipes have dedicated primitives, this is simply to
avoid having the perl code in the recipe. In these cases, we include
the primitive documentation with that of the recipe. For the main
science recipes, we will describe the recipes at molecular level
here, with the details of the primitives in a subsequent section.

\subsection{System Verification Recipes and Primitives}

\subsubsection{ARRAY\_TESTS}

Strictly speaking, the ARRAY\_TESTS recipe is not part of the \ORACDR\
spectroscopy suite; each instrument provides its own array tests
recipe if it requires one. However, if one is provided, it can
generate bad pixel masks and read-noise measurements that will be used
by the rest of the spectroscopy pipeline. In fact, a read-noise number
is mandatory for the spectroscopy pipeline, and thus if not determined
by an array tests procedure, has to be supplied manually, usually by
the instrument scientist. The CGS4 specific array tests recipe is
described here, as it is currently a good example.

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:ARRAY_TESTS
\paragraph{ARRAY\_TESTS\label{ARRAY_TESTS}\index{ARRAY\ TESTS}}

Tests the array, determining the readnoise and dark current


\mbox{}

Performs array tests for an array. This recipe uses the raw data,
reduces it, and calculates read noise, median and modal dark currents
for the array. It assumes that data is taken in the standard CGS4
array tests configuration



See the \_ARRAY\_TESTS\_ CGS4 primitive for details.


%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_ARRAY_TESTS_
\paragraph{\_ARRAY\_TESTS\_\label{_ARRAY_TESTS_}\index{\ ARRAY\ TESTS\ }}

CGS4 array tests


\mbox{}

Calculates the readnoise and dark current parameters for the array.
Also forms bad pixel masks.



This primitive ensures that the BIAS and DARK frames taken as part of
the array tests are also filed with the calibration system so that
they can be used to reduce subsequent data.



The \_FIND\_BAD\_PIXELS\_ primitive is called to detect bad pixels at each
stage of the array tests.



The \_ARRAY\_TESTS\_STATISTICS\_ primitive is called to determine the
readnoise and dark currents.


%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_ARRAY_TESTS_STATISTICS_
\paragraph{\_ARRAY\_TESTS\_STATISTICS\_\label{_ARRAY_TESTS_STATISTICS_}\index{\ ARRAY\ TESTS\ STATISTICS\ }}

Determines array tests statistics


\mbox{}

Does the array tests statistics for CGS4.



The DARK frames used must have been reduced with the \_REDUCE\_DARK\_
primitive; this is normally called from the \_ARRAY\_TESTS\_ primitive
during array test reduction.



The basic principle used to determine the readnoise is to subtract 2
dark frames of the same exposure time, on the assumption that the
readnoise is the only difference between them.


%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_FIND_BAD_PIXELS_
\paragraph{\_FIND\_BAD\_PIXELS\_\label{_FIND_BAD_PIXELS_}\index{\ FIND\ BAD\ PIXELS\ }}

Finds bad pixels in a frame


\mbox{}

Used in array tests to add the bad pixels detected in this frame into the 
bad pixel mask.



Applies thresholds to the data frames and flags pixels outside
the limits as bad.



For BIAS frames, we do a 3-sigma clipped stats and flag pixels more
than 6 sigma from the mean. The actual threshold limits applied are
reported. In addition, we also flag pixels whose BIAS variance is more
than 6-sigma above the mean in a 3-sigma clipped stats.



For DARK frames, we set the thresholds to 1700 and 15 if the exposure
is greater than 80 seconds, and 1500 and $-$100 if it is not. This will
need updating if MICHELLE elects to use an automated bad pixel
detection scheme in the future and when UIST support is added - these
values are CGS4 specific.



The bad pixels detected are added into the current bad pixel mask and
then this is filed with the calibration system as a new and current
bad pixel mask.


\subsubsection{EMISSIVITY}

It is not strictly necessary for each instrument to be able to take
emissivity data, though currently both CGS4 and MICHELLE do, and it is
strongly anticipated that UIST also will.

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:EMISSIVITY
\paragraph{EMISSIVITY\label{EMISSIVITY}\index{EMISSIVITY}}

A recipe to measure telescope emissivity


\mbox{}

Used to measure the telescope emissivity. See the \_EMISSIVITY\_
primitive for details of the calculation, this recipe simply calls
\_REDUCE\_SINGLE\_FRAME\_ followed by \_EMISSIVITY\_.


%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_EMISSIVITY_
\paragraph{\_EMISSIVITY\_\label{_EMISSIVITY_}\index{\ EMISSIVITY\ }}

Calculates Telescope Emissivity


\mbox{}

Expects to be run on a SKY frame (taken pointing at the sky) and an
OBJECT frame (taken pointing at the mirror covers ie dome).



File extensions created:



Frames:

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{\_ess}] \mbox{}

Emissivity Sky Spectrum

\item[\textbf{\_eds}] \mbox{}

Emissivity Dome Spectrum

\end{description}


Group:



Group file contains ratio of sky and dome spectra

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{\_sm}] \mbox{}

Smoothed by 5 pixels - used to select region

\end{description}


Spectra are extracted from both files and divided by the exposure time
for that frame.



The "emissivity" spectrum is the ratio of these two spectra.



The emissivity spectrum is smoothed with a box of 5 pixels.  The
location of the minimum of the smoothed spectrum is found, and a
5-pixel window centred at this point is extracted from the sky and
dome spectra.  The mean values of these two windows are calculated and
printed.  The ratio of these two mean values is printed as the
emissivity.


\subsection{Calibration Frame Recipes}

\subsubsection{Flat Fields}

The REDUCE\_FLAT recipe will reduce a FLAT field observation. FLAT
observations are usually taken by observing the black-body source in
the CGS4 calibration unit, though the Tungsten-Halogen lamp is used as
the shorter CGS4 wavelengths. Standard operating procedures for
MICHELLE flats have yet to be ascertained, though REDUCE\_FLAT will
work fine if the (warm) shutter of the instrument is used as a black
body source. Sky flats will probably be reduced by an (as yet
unwritten) separate recipe.

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:REDUCE_FLAT
\paragraph{REDUCE\_FLAT\label{REDUCE_FLAT}\index{REDUCE\ FLAT}}

Reduces a spectroscopy Flat Field


\mbox{}

Reduces a flat field in the conventional manner, including
normalisation by a model of the blackbody source. Files the normalised
flat field frame for use by subsequent flat fielding operations.


%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_NORMALISE_FLAT_BY_BB_
\paragraph{\_NORMALISE\_FLAT\_BY\_BB\_\label{_NORMALISE_FLAT_BY_BB_}\index{\ NORMALISE\ FLAT\ BY\ BB\ }}

Normalise a flat field frame with a Black Body curve


\mbox{}

Normalises a frame (usually a CGS4 flat field frame).



First, creates a black body spectrum, using the temperature from the
BBTEMP header, grows this to the size of the image, and divides by
it. Then divides the image by the image's mean pixel value, so as to
normalise it's absolute level to 1.

\subparagraph*{NOTE\label{_NORMALISE_FLAT_BY_BB__NOTE}\index{ NORMALISE FLAT BY BB !NOTE}}

Uses the BBTEMP FITS header. Perhaps this should have a system internal
translated value to cope with future instrumentation.


\subsubsection{Arc Lamp observations}

The REDUCE\_ARC recipe reduces a CGS4 ARC lamp observation. Currently
the arc frame is not actually used for wavelength calibration, though
this will probably change shortly.

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:REDUCE_ARC
\paragraph{REDUCE\_ARC\label{REDUCE_ARC}\index{REDUCE\ ARC}}

Reduces an Arc Lamp observation


\mbox{}

Reduces an arc lamp observation in the conventional manner, and
applies an estimated wavelength scale (based on the CGS4 motor
positions) so that you can easily refer to an arc line list or map to
check that you are hitting your wavelength region of interest.

\subparagraph*{NOTE\label{REDUCE_ARC_NOTE}\index{REDUCE ARC!NOTE}}

Currently, this recipe does not attempt to use the arc lamp data to
carry out proper wavelength calibration. This will change at some
point in the future.


The REDUCE\_DARK recipe will reduce and file a DARK observation. In
practice this is very rarely used as the dark current of the array is
intrinsically subtracted when subtracting a sky or offset beam frame.

\subsubsection{Dark Frames}


%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:REDUCE_DARK
\paragraph{REDUCE\_DARK\label{REDUCE_DARK}\index{REDUCE\ DARK}}

Reduce a dark frame


\mbox{}

Reduces a Dark frame. This is generally only used by the array test
and engineering. It is unusual to require a dark frame with CGS4 as
the dark frame would be the same in the offset beam or sky image and
thus cancels when sky subtraction is carried out.


\subsubsection{Bias Frames}

The REDUCE\_BIAS recipe reduces a bias observation. The default BIAS
observation takes 3 integrations, each containing many exposures. The
REDUCE\_BIAS recipe forms a variance array based on the variance of the
3 integrations in the observation.


%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:REDUCE_BIAS
\paragraph{REDUCE\_BIAS\label{REDUCE_BIAS}\index{REDUCE\ BIAS}}

Reduce a spectrocopy BIAS observation


\mbox{}

Reduces a Spectroscopy BIAS observation, including coadding multiple
integrations. Files the reduced bias frame for use by subsequent
reduction of STARE and CHOP mode data.


%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_REDUCE_BIAS_
\paragraph{\_REDUCE\_BIAS\_\label{_REDUCE_BIAS_}\index{\ REDUCE\ BIAS\ }}

Reduces a spectroscopy BIAS frame


\mbox{}

Averages together multiple integrations to make the output file data array.



If there are more than 3 integrations, a variance array is created as the
statistical variance of the individual input integrations.



Otherwise, the variance is simply from the readnoise added to the integrations
before averaging.



\subsection{Calibration Star Recipes}

\subsubsection{STANDARD\_STAR}
%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:STANDARD_STAR
\paragraph{STANDARD\_STAR\label{STANDARD_STAR}\index{STANDARD\ STAR}}

Reduce a standard star observation


\mbox{}

This recipe reduces a standard star observation, assuming that it is
observed in a conventional nod-along-slit manner. It extracts the
spectrum of the standard, acquires details of the star (either from a
locally held list, or from SIMBAD), and files it such that it can be
later used to create divided by standard and flux calibrated spectra
of targets that are observed.

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:STANDARD_STAR_NOFLAT
\paragraph{STANDARD\_STAR\_NOFLAT\label{STANDARD_STAR_NOFLAT}\index{STANDARD\ STAR\ NOFLAT}}

Reduce a standard star without flat fielding


\mbox{}

This recipe reduces a standard star observation, assuming that it is
observed in a conventional nod-along-slit manner. It extracts the
spectrum of the standard, acquires details of the star (either from a
locally held list, or from SIMBAD), and files it such that it can be
later used to create divided by standard and flux calibrated spectra
of targets that are observed.



This recipe does not attempt to flat-field the frames.

%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_STANDARD_STAR_
\paragraph{\_STANDARD\_STAR\_\label{_STANDARD_STAR_}\index{\ STANDARD\ STAR\ }}




\mbox{}

\subsubsection{POINT\_SOURCE}

The POINT\_SOURCE recipe reduces observations of point sources, with
nodding along the slit or off to sky (the reason you'd go off to sky
with a point source being that it's in a crowded field).


Variants: \\
\_NOFLAT - does not do flat fielding \\
\_NOSTD - does not ratio by standard star \\
\_MAYBESTD - ratios by standard if there is one, doesn't complain if not. \\
\_NOFLAT\_NOSTD - does not flat field or ratio by standard star \\
\_BASIC - reduced processing for faster execution (maybe - will see if needed) \\

For reducing point source observations


\mbox{}

A spectroscopy recipe for observations of Point Sources
Assumes that the data are taken in a pair-wise manner.



This recipe is suitable for all point source data taken in a pair-wise
manner, including nodding along the slit, nodding to sky, and
chop-mode observations.



The final product of this recipe is an spectrum of the target, with an
approximate wavelength and flux scale applied. Processing includes
optimal extraction and division by a standard star.



For details of the data reduction process used, see the documentation
for the individual primitives.

\mbox{}

See the POINT\_SOURCE recipe documentation. This version is identical except
that it does not attempt to flat field the data.



If you acquire suitable flat fields later in the night, you should
reduce them first, then re-process your target data with the
POINT\_SOURCE recipe.



Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving and
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
inbetween.

\paragraph{POINT\_SOURCE\_NOSTD\label{POINT_SOURCE_NOSTD}\index{POINT\ SOURCE\ NOSTD}}

As POINT\_SOURCE but without using a standard star


\mbox{}

See the POINT\_SOURCE recipe documentation. This version is identical
except that it does not use a standard star, and thus processing stops
after extraction of the spectrum from the group frame.



If you acquire suitable standard star observations later in the night,
you should reduce them first, then re-process your target data with
the POINT\_SOURCE recipe.



Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving and

inbetween.


\subsubsection{FAINT\_POINT\_SOURCE}

The FAINT\_POINT\_SOURCE recipe is similar to POINT\_SOURCE, except in
determining where to centre the opt-extract windows. With
POINT\_SOURCE, the windows are centred on peaks and troughs detected
in the y-profile of the sky subtracted group image. This is also the
case for STANDARD\_STAR. However, STANDARD\_STAR writes the locations
of the beams to the rows calibration system. FAINT\_POINT\_SOURCE gets
these values from the calibration system rather than the y-profile of
the image. 

Thus, FAINT\_POINT\_SOURCE is useful both for crowded fields or
faint targets, where it's not obvious from the group image where to
extract. For this to be useful, the object of interest must be centred
on the same rows as the standard star was. This will be the case unless
you deliberately change the telescope-instrument aperture, peak-up row
or offset distance between observing the standard and the target.

Variants: \\
\_NOFLAT - does not do flat fielding \\
\_NOSTD - does not ratio by standard star \\
\_MAYBESTD - ratios by standard if there is one, doesn't complain if not. \\
\_NOFLAT\_NOSTD - does not flat field or ratio by standard star \\
\_BASIC - reduced processing for faster execution (maybe - will see if needed) \\

\subsubsection{Extended source with a stable sky background}

The EXTENDED\_SOURCE\_SEPARATE\_SKY recipe is for use when the sky is
sufficiently stable, that you do not need to spend half your time
observing it. This is only expected to be of use with CGS4 echelle
observations. For point sources, you would nod along the slit anyway.

Variants: \\
\_NOFLAT - does not do flat fielding \\
\_NOSTD - does not ratio by standard star \\
\_NOFLAT\_NOSTD - does not flat field or ratio by standard star \\
\_BASIC - reduced processing for faster execution (maybe - will see if needed) \\

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY
\paragraph{EXTENDED\_SOURCE\_WITH\_SEPARATE\_SKY\label{EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY}\index{EXTENDED\ SOURCE\ WITH\ SEPARATE\ SKY}}

For extended source on stable sky background.


\mbox{}

For use when you want to take several on-target OBJECT frames for each
off-target SKY frame. It is only sensible to use this recipe when
working with low, stable sky counts, and with extended targets where
you cannot nod along the slit. Currently, this can only really be
considered to apply to certain observations using the CGS4 echelle
grating.



Before the pipeline sees an OBJECT frame with this recipe, you must
have had it reduce a suitable SKY frame with the REDUCE\_SKY recipe,
otherwise the pipeline cannot continue. Thus you should use a sequence
like "SKY, OBJECT, OBJECT" rather than "OBJECT, SKY, OBJECT". In each
set of observations you can follow the SKY frame with as many OBJECT
frames as you like. There is obviously a trade-off in that the more
OBJECT frames you do, the more time you spend observing your target
rather than the sky, but also the longer the interval between SKY
frames, and thus the more liable you are to be affected by sky
variation.

\mbox{}

Reduces a blank sky observation, and files it with the calibration
system for use in subsequent data reduction. Note that in pair-wise
observing procedures, you should generally not be taking SKY frames -
both beam positions are classified as OBJECT frames, and should be
handled by whatever pair-wise recipe is being used for the main-beam
frames.


\subsection{Utility Recipes}

\subsubsection{Night Logs}

The NIGHT\_LOG recipe is the default recipe for generating summary
logs of a list of observations. The NIGHT\_LOG\_LONG variant adds more
details to the log file.

\paragraph{NIGHT\_LOG\label{NIGHT_LOG}\index{NIGHT\ LOG}}

Creates a text log summarising file headers


\mbox{}

This recipe is used to create a text log summarising the file headers
of a group of observations. It is often used to create a log file
describing a whole night's worth of observations.



For full details, see the documentation for the spectroscopy
\_NIGHT\_LOG primitive.



This recipe calls the primitive in such a way that the log file
appears in \$ORAC\_DATA\_IN.



An "on-the-fly" night log is created in \$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT as 
spectroscopy data is reduced by the pipeline. This is done by a
call to \_NIGHT\_LOG\_ from \_SPECTROSCOPY\_HELLO\_

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:NIGHT_LOG_LONG
\paragraph{NIGHT\_LOG\_LONG\label{NIGHT_LOG_LONG}\index{NIGHT\ LOG\ LONG}}

%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_NIGHT_LOG_
\paragraph{\_NIGHT\_LOG\_\label{_NIGHT_LOG_}\index{\ NIGHT\ LOG\ }}

Produces a text listing a summary of a frame's headers.


\mbox{}

Produces a line of text in a log file summarising the header values of
the frame. Is used both as part of the generall data reduction, so as
to produce an on-the-fly listing of what has been reduced so far, and
as part of the NIGHT\_LOG recipe to provide a summary of a set (usually
the whole night's worth) of observations.

EXTENDED\_SOURCE as appropriate. Use POINT\_SOURCE if in doubt.

Historical data taken with SOURCE\_WITH\_NOD\_TO\_BLANK\_SKY should now
be reduced with EXTENDED\_SOURCE\_WITH\_SEPARATE\_SKY.

\section{Calibration Information}

\ORACDR\ records calibration information, such as dark frames, flat
fields, and the read noise, within index files, one for each type of
calibration information.  When the pipeline needs a calibration frame
it searches the index file for the best matching entry subject to a
set of rules. Each recipe reports the calibrations it has used.  If no
suitable calibration exists, the pipeline exits with an error message
stating this fact.  For further details see
\xref{SUN/230}{sun230}{calibration_selection}.

You can also select a specific calibration using the {\tt -calib}
command-line option, provided the chosen calibration has an entry
in the appropriate index file.  See
\begin{latexonly}
the section on
\end{latexonly}
\xref{calibration options}{sun230}{calibration_options}
\begin{latexonly}

\end{latexonly}
for details and examples.
