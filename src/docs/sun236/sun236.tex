\section{Introduction}

This document describes the spectroscopy recipies and primitives
included with ORAC-DR. See SUN230 for general ORAC-DR documentation
and SUN232 for information on ORAC-DR imaging data reduction.

At this time (November 2001), ORAC-DR's spectroscopy suite is designed
to reduce data from the UKIRT spectrometer suite - CGS4 and
MICHELLE. Support for UIST is iminenet. The recipies and primitives
are written in such a way as to make the addition of new instruments
simple.

\section{Recipe and Primitive Architecture}

In general, an ORAC-DR recipe is simply a list of primitives, which
are executed in turn on the data from each observation that is passed
through the pipeline. The primitives form building blocks, each
carrying out an atomic data reduction operation. Thus, the recipe is
readable, understanable and to some extent modifyable by someone not
familiar with the primitive internals - for example an observer or
scientist reducing data and wishing to add or remove steps from the
data reduction process. The primitives themselves are implemented in
perl5 and are not designed to be usefully modifyable by a
non-programmer.

In actual fact, it has been found to be beneficial in many places to
take this abstraction one level deeper - in the spectroscopy pipeline
many of the steps which we wish to denote in the recipe as a single
primitive are themselves too complex to be considered an atomic data
reduction operation, perhaps a good analogy is that be considered a
molecular operation, themselves implemented as a simple list of
primitives which carry out the true atomic operations. In some cases
there is simple logic - generally simple flow controll switches - for
example ``if'' clauses at the molecular level, though this code is
simple and these molecular level primitives can be usefully modified
to add or remove steps by a typical astronomer.

\section{The Recipies}

Each recipe has an in-code documentation section, which documents the
recipie concerned. Here, we simply divide the recipies into groups
corresponding to the type of observations they reduce, and give the
recipe documentation.

Some of the recipies have dedicated primitives, this is simply to
avoid having the perl code in the recipe. In these cases, we include
the primitive documentation with that of the recipe. For the main
science recipies, we will describe the recipies at molecular level
here, with the details of the primitives in a subsequent section.

\subsection{System Verification Recipies and Primitives}

\subsubsection{ARRAY\_TESTS}

Strictly speaking, the ARRAY\_TESTS recipe is not part of the ORAC-DR
spectroscopy suite - each instrument provides its own array tests
recipe if it requires one. However, if one is provided, it can
generate bad pixel masks and readnoise measurements that will be used
by the rest of the spectroscopy pipeline. In fact, a readnoise number
is mandatory for the spectroscopy pipeline, and thus if not determined
by an array tests proceedure, has to be supplied manually, usually by
the instrument scientist. The CGS4 specific array tests recipe is
described here, as it is currently a good example.

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:ARRAY_TESTS
\paragraph*{ARRAY\_TESTS -- tests the array, determining the readnoise and dark current\label{ARRAY_TESTS_--_tests_the_array_determining_the_readnoise_and_dark_current}\index{ARRAY\ TESTS -- tests the array, determining the readnoise and dark current}}



\subparagraph*{DESCRIPTION\label{ARRAY_TESTS_--_tests_the_array_determining_the_readnoise_and_dark_current_DESCRIPTION}\index{ARRAY TESTS -- tests the array determining the readnoise and dark current!DESCRIPTION}}

Performs array tests for an array. This recipe uses the raw data,
reduces it, and calculates read noise, median and modal dark currents
for the array. It assumes that data is taken in the standard CGS4
array tests configuration



See the \_ARRAY\_TESTS\_ CGS4 primitive for details.

%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_ARRAY_TESTS_
\paragraph*{\_ARRAY\_TESTS\_ -- CGS4 array tests\label{_ARRAY_TESTS_--_CGS4_array_tests}\index{\ ARRAY\ TESTS\  -- CGS4 array tests}}



\subparagraph*{DESCRIPTION\label{_ARRAY_TESTS_--_CGS4_array_tests_DESCRIPTION}\index{ ARRAY TESTS -- CGS4 array tests!DESCRIPTION}}

Calculates the readnoise and dark current parameters for the array.
Also forms bad pixel masks.



This primitive ensures that the BIAS and DARK frames taken as part of
the array tests are also filed with the calibration system so that
they can be used to reduce subsequent data.



The \_FIND\_BAD\_PIXELS\_ primitive is called to detect bad pixels at each
stage of the array tests.



The \_ARRAY\_TESTS\_STATISTICS\_ primitive is called to determine the
readnoise and dark currents.

\paragraph*{\_ARRAY\_TESTS\_STATISTICS\_ -- Determines array tests statistics\label{_ARRAY_TESTS_STATISTICS_--_Determines_array_tests_statistics}\index{\ ARRAY\ TESTS\ STATISTICS\  -- Determines array tests statistics}}



\subparagraph*{DESCRIPTION\label{_ARRAY_TESTS_STATISTICS_--_Determines_array_tests_statistics_DESCRIPTION}\index{ ARRAY TESTS STATISTICS -- Determines array tests statistics!DESCRIPTION}}

Does the array tests statistics for CGS4.



The DARK frames used must have been reduced with the \_REDUCE\_DARK\_
primitive; this is normally called from the \_ARRAY\_TESTS\_ primitive
during array test reduction.



The basic principle used to determine the readnoise is to subtract 2
dark frames of the same exposure time, on the assumption that the
readnoise is the only difference between them.

%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_FIND_BAD_PIXELS_
\paragraph*{\_FIND\_BAD\_PIXELS\_ -- Finds bad pixels in a frame\label{_FIND_BAD_PIXELS_--_Finds_bad_pixels_in_a_frame}\index{\ FIND\ BAD\ PIXELS\  -- Finds bad pixels in a frame}}



\subparagraph*{DESCRIPTION\label{_FIND_BAD_PIXELS_--_Finds_bad_pixels_in_a_frame_DESCRIPTION}\index{ FIND BAD PIXELS -- Finds bad pixels in a frame!DESCRIPTION}}

Used in array tests to add the bad pixels detected in this frame into the 
bad pixel mask.



Applies thresholds to the data frames and flags pixels outside
the limits as bad.



For BIAS frames, we do a 3-sigma clipped stats and flag pixels more
than 6 sigma from the mean. The actual threshold limits applied are
reported. In addition, we also flag pixels whose BIAS variance is more
than 6-sigma above the mean in a 3-sigma clipped stats.



For DARK frames, we set the thresholds to 1700 and 15 if the exposure
is greater than 80 seconds, and 1500 and -100 if it is not. This will
need updating if MICHELLE elects to use an automated bad pixel
detection scheme in the future and when UIST support is added - these
values are CGS4 specific.



The bad pixels detected are added into the current bad pixel mask and
then this is filed with the calibration system as a new and current
bad pixel mask.

\subsubsection{EMISSIVITY}

It is not strictly necessary for each instrument to be able to take
emissivity data, though currently buth CGS4 and MICHELLE do, and it is
strongly anticipated that UIST also will.

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:EMISSIVITY
\paragraph*{EMISSIVITY -- a recipe to measure telescope emissivity\label{EMISSIVITY_--_a_recipe_to_measure_telescope_emissivity}\index{EMISSIVITY -- a recipe to measure telescope emissivity}}



\subparagraph*{DESCRIPTION\label{EMISSIVITY_--_a_recipe_to_measure_telescope_emissivity_DESCRIPTION}\index{EMISSIVITY -- a recipe to measure telescope emissivity!DESCRIPTION}}

Used to measure the telescope emissivity. See the \_EMISSIVITY\_
primitive for details of the calculation, this recipe simply calls
\_REDUCE\_SINGLE\_FRAME\_ followed by \_EMISSIVITY\_.

\paragraph*{\_EMISSIVITY\_ -- Calculates Telescope Emissivity\label{_EMISSIVITY_--_Calculates_Telescope_Emissivity}\index{\ EMISSIVITY\  -- Calculates Telescope Emissivity}}



\subparagraph*{DESCRIPTION\label{_EMISSIVITY_--_Calculates_Telescope_Emissivity_DESCRIPTION}\index{ EMISSIVITY -- Calculates Telescope Emissivity!DESCRIPTION}}

Expects to be run on a SKY frame (taken pointing at the sky) and an
OBJECT frame (taken pointing at the mirror covers ie dome).



File extensions created:



Frames:



\_ess: Emissivity Sky Spectrum



\_eds: Emissivity Dome Spectrum



Group:



Group file contains ratio of sky and dome spectra



\_sm: Smoothed by 5 pixels - used to select region



Spectra are extracted from both files and divided by the exposure time
for that frame.



The "emissivity" spectrum is the ratio of these two spectra.



The emissivity spectrum is smoothed with a box of 5 pixels.  The
location of the minimum of the smoothed spectrum is found, and a
5-pixel window centred at this point is extracted from the sky and
dome spectra.  The mean values of these two windows are calculated and
printed.  The ratio of these two mean values is printed as the
emissivity.

\subsection{Calibration Frame Recipies}

\subsubsection{Flat Fields}

The REDUCE\_FLAT recipe will reduce a FLAT field observation. FLAT
observations are usually taken by observing the black-body source in
the CGS4 calibration unit, though the Tungsten-Halogen lamp is used as
the shorter CGS4 wavelengths. Standard operating proceedures for
MICHELLE flats have yet to be ascertained, though REDUCE\_FLAT will
work fine if the (warm) shutter of the instrument is used as a black
body source. Sky flats will probably be reduced by an (as yet
unwritten) seperate recipe.

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:REDUCE_FLAT
\paragraph*{REDUCE\_FLAT\label{REDUCE_FLAT}\index{REDUCE\ FLAT}}

Reduces a spectroscopy Flat Field

\subparagraph*{AUTHOR\label{REDUCE_FLAT_AUTHOR}\index{REDUCE FLAT!AUTHOR}}

Paul Hirst <p.hirst@jach.hawaii.edu>

\subparagraph*{DESCIPTION\label{REDUCE_FLAT_DESCIPTION}\index{REDUCE FLAT!DESCIPTION}}

Reduces a flat field in the conventional manner, including
normalisation by a model of the blackbody source. Files the normalised
flat field frame for use by subsequent flat fielding operations.

\subparagraph*{NOTES\label{REDUCE_FLAT_NOTES}\index{REDUCE FLAT!NOTES}}

Normalising by a black body probably isn't optimal for sky-flats,
especially if they contain strong lines.
This recipe will need updating if Michelle is to use sky flats.


%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_NORMALISE_FLAT_BY_BB_
\paragraph*{\_NORMALISE\_FLAT\_BY\_BB\_\label{_NORMALISE_FLAT_BY_BB_}\index{\ NORMALISE\ FLAT\ BY\ BB\ }}

Normalse a flat field frame with a Black Body curve

\subparagraph*{DESCRIPTION\label{_NORMALISE_FLAT_BY_BB__DESCRIPTION}\index{ NORMALISE FLAT BY BB !DESCRIPTION}}

Normalises a frame (usually a CGS4 flat field frame).



First, creates a black body spectrum, using the temperature from the
BBTEMP header, grows this to the size of the image, and divides by
it. Then divides the image by the image's mean pixel value, so as to
normalise it's absolute level to 1.

\subparagraph*{NOTE\label{_NORMALISE_FLAT_BY_BB__NOTE}\index{ NORMALISE FLAT BY BB !NOTE}}

Uses the BBTEMP FITS header. Perhaps this should have a system internal
translated value to cope with future instrumentation.

\subparagraph*{AUTHOR\label{_NORMALISE_FLAT_BY_BB__AUTHOR}\index{ NORMALISE FLAT BY BB !AUTHOR}}

Paul Hirst <p.hirst@jach.hawaii.edu>


\subsubsection{Arc Lamp observations}

The REDUCE\_ARC recipe reduces a CGS4 ARC lamp observation. Currently
the arc frame is not actually used for wavelength calibration, though
this will probably change shortly.

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:REDUCE_ARC
\paragraph*{REDUCE\_ARC\label{REDUCE_ARC}\index{REDUCE\ ARC}}

Reduces an Arc Lamp observation

\subparagraph*{AUTHORS\label{REDUCE_ARC_AUTHORS}\index{REDUCE ARC!AUTHORS}}

Frossie Economou <frossie@jach.hawaii.edu>
Paul Hirst <p.hirst@jach.hawaii.edu>

\subparagraph*{DESCIPTION\label{REDUCE_ARC_DESCIPTION}\index{REDUCE ARC!DESCIPTION}}

Reduces an arc lamp observation in the conventional manner, and
applies an estimated wavelength scale (based on the CGS4 motor
positions) so that you can easily refer to an arc line list or map to
check that you are hitting your wavelength region of interest.

\subparagraph*{NOTE\label{REDUCE_ARC_NOTE}\index{REDUCE ARC!NOTE}}

Currently, this recipe does not attempt to use the arc lamp data to
carry out proper wavelength calibration. This will change at some
point in the future.


The REDUCE\_DARK recipe will reduce and file a DARK observation. In
practice this is very rarely used as the dark current of the array is
intrinsically subtracted when subtracting a sky or offset beam frame.

\subsubsection{Dark Frames}


%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:REDUCE_DARK

Frossie Economou <frossie@jach.hawaii.edu>
Paul Hirst <p.hirst@jach.hawaii.edu>

\subparagraph*{DESCIPTION\label{REDUCE_DARK_DESCIPTION}\index{REDUCE DARK!DESCIPTION}}

Reduces a Dark frame. This is generally only used by the array test
and engineering. It is unusual to require a dark frame with CGS4 as
the dark frame would be the same in the offset beam or sky image and
thus cancels when sky subtration is carried out.


\subsubsection{Bias Frames}

The REDUCE\_BIAS recipe reduces a bias observation. The default BIAS
observation takes 3 integrations, each containing many exposures. The
REDUCE\_BIAS recipe forms a variance array based on the variance of the
3 integrations in the observation.

\subparagraph*{DESCIPTION\label{REDUCE_BIAS_DESCIPTION}\index{REDUCE BIAS!DESCIPTION}}

Reduces a Spectroscopy BIAS observation, including coadding multiple

reduction of STARE and CHOP mode data.

\subparagraph*{NOTES\label{REDUCE_BIAS_NOTES}\index{REDUCE BIAS!NOTES}}

Creates a variance array for the bias frame, determined from the 
variance of the mltiple integrations in the bias observation. There
should be at least 3 integrations in a BIAS observation.

\subparagraph*{SEE ALSO\label{REDUCE_BIAS_SEE_ALSO}\index{REDUCE BIAS!SEE ALSO}}

The \_REDUCE\_BIAS\_ spectroscopy primitive.


%% ORACDRDOC_PRIMITIVE:_REDUCE_BIAS_
\paragraph*{\_REDUCE\_BIAS\_\label{_REDUCE_BIAS_}\index{\ REDUCE\ BIAS\ }}

\subparagraph*{DESCRIPTION\label{_REDUCE_BIAS__DESCRIPTION}\index{ REDUCE BIAS !DESCRIPTION}}

Averages together multiple integrations to make the output file data array.



If there are more than 3 integrations, a variance array is created as the
statistical variance of the individual input integrations.



Otherwise, the variance is simply from the readnoise added to the integrations
before averaging.

The POINT\_SOURCE recipe reduces observations of point sources, with
nodding along the slit or off to sky (the reason you'd go off to sky
with a point source being that it's in a crowded field).


Variants: \\
\_NOFLAT - does not do flat fielding \\
\_NOSTD - does not ratio by standard star \\
\_MAYBESTD - ratios by standard if there is one, doesn't complain if not. \\
\_NOFLAT\_NOSTD - does not flat field or ratio by standard star \\

\subsubsection{Extended source with a stable sky background}

The EXTENDED\_SOURCE\_SEPARATE\_SKY recipe is for use when the sky is
sufficinetly stable, that you do not need to spend half your time
observing it. This is only expected to be of use with CGS4 echelle
observations. For point sources, you would nod along the slit anyway.

Variants: \\
\_NOFLAT - does not do flat fielding \\
\_NOSTD - does not ratio by standard star \\
\_NOFLAT\_NOSTD - does not flat field or ratio by standard star \\
\_BASIC - reduced processing for faster execution (maybe - will see if needed) \\

%% ORACDRDOC_RECIPE:EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY
\paragraph*{EXTENDED\_SOURCE\_WITH\_SEPARATE\_SKY -- For extended source on stable sky background.\label{EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY_--_For_extended_source_on_stable_sky_background_}\index{EXTENDED\ SOURCE\ WITH\ SEPARATE\ SKY -- For extended source on stable sky background.}}

For use when you want to take several on-target OBJECT frames for each
off-target SKY frame. It is only sensible to use this recipe when
working with low, stable sky counts, and with extended targets where
you cannot nod along the slit. Currently, this can only really be
considered to apply to certain observations using the CGS4 echelle
grating.



Before the pipeline sees an OBJECT frame with this recipe, you must
have had it reduce a suitable SKY frame with the REDUCE\_SKY recipe,
otherwise the pipeline cannot continue. Thus you should use a sequence
like "SKY, OBJECT, OBJECT" rather than "OBJECT, SKY, OBJECT". In each
set of observations you can follow the SKY frame with as many OBJECT
frames as you like. There is obviously a trade-off in that the more
OBJECT frames you do, the more time you spend observing your target
rather than the sky, but also the longer the interval between SKY
frames, and thus the more liable you are to be affected by sky
variation.

\subsubsection{Night Logs}

The NIGHT\_LOG recipe is the default recipe for generating summary

details to the log file.

\paragraph*{NIGHT\_LOG\label{NIGHT_LOG}\index{NIGHT\ LOG}}

Creates a text log summarising file headers

\subparagraph*{DESCRIPTION\label{NIGHT_LOG_DESCRIPTION}\index{NIGHT LOG!DESCRIPTION}}

This recipe is used to create a text log summarising the file headers
of a group of observations. It is often used to create a log file
describing a whole night's worth of observations.



For full details, see the documentation for the spectroscopy
\_NIGHT\_LOG primitive.



This recipie calls the primitive in such a way that the log file
appears in \$ORAC\_DATA\_IN.



An "on-the-fly" night log is created in \$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT as 
spectroscopy data is reduced by the pipeline. This is done by a
call to \_NIGHT\_LOG\_ from \_SPECTROSCOPY\_HELLO\_

\paragraph*{\_NIGHT\_LOG\_\label{_NIGHT_LOG_}\index{\ NIGHT\ LOG\ }}

Produces a text listing a summary of a frame's headers.

\subparagraph*{DESCRIPTION\label{_NIGHT_LOG__DESCRIPTION}\index{ NIGHT LOG !DESCRIPTION}}

Produces a line of text in a log file summarising the header values of
the frame. Is used both as part of the generall data reduction, so as
to produce an on-the-fly listing of what has been reduced so far, and
as part of the NIGHT\_LOG recipe to provide a summary of a set (usually
the whole night's worth) of observations.

\subparagraph*{ARGUMENTS\label{_NIGHT_LOG__ARGUMENTS}\index{ NIGHT LOG !ARGUMENTS}}

The following arguments are available:

\begin{description}
\item[OUT] \mbox{}

When set (to any value) the log file is written to \emph{\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT}
rather than to \emph{\$ORAC\_DATA\_IN}.

\end{description}
\subparagraph*{OUTPUT DATA\label{_NIGHT_LOG__OUTPUT_DATA}\index{ NIGHT LOG !OUTPUT DATA}}

The text log file \emph{$<$date$>$.nightlog}, where
$<$date$>$ is the UT date.



The file is in \emph{\$ORAC\_DATA\_IN} by default, or in \emph{\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT} if
the OUT argument is set. This primitive is called from
\_SPECTROSCOPY\_HELLO\_ with the OUT argument set, so the on-the-fly
nightlog appears in \emph{\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT}, and without the argument from
the NIGHT\_LOG recipe, so that we can create a summary of a night's
observations in \emph{\$ORAC\_DATA\_IN}.



The on-the-fly log in \emph{\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT} is always appended to, being
created only if it doesn't exist.  Thus multiple entries for the same
observation may exist in the on-the-fly log if the pipeline is rerun.



The "clean" log file in \emph{\$ORAC\_DATA\_IN} is re-started if the observation
number equals 1 and is appended to otherwise, being created as necessary.

\subparagraph*{NOTES\label{_NIGHT_LOG__NOTES}\index{ NIGHT LOG !NOTES}}\begin{itemize}
\item 

The logfile created by this primitive does not follow the standard
ORAC-DR naming convention (\emph{log.xxxx}) since it can be used to write
log files to directories other than \emph{\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT} and unique file
names are required.

\item 

No external algorithm engines are required by this primitive.

\item 

Run with the oracdr option -resume to prevent deletion of allready existing group files

\item 

Run with the oracdr option -noeng for efficiency

\subparagraph*{DESCRIPTION\label{_ALIGN_SPECTRUM_TO_STD__DESCRIPTION}\index{ ALIGN SPECTRUM TO STD !DESCRIPTION}}

Cross correlates the spectrum with the standard star spectrum and shifts
it, so as to get better atmospheric cancelation if the instrument has
flexed between the standard and the target observations.



Takes a STANDARD parameter telling it the name of the std to use.



Doesn't do anything unless the group NDIMS is 1
