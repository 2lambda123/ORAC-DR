%  Name:
%     sun232.tex

%  Purpose:
%     SUN documentation for ORAC-DR imaging (SUN/232)

%  Notes:
%     -  Has definitions to give small capitals for CCDPACK,
%     CONVERT, CURSA, GAIA, KAPPA, PHOTOM, PISA, and POLPACK.
%     Each command is \package.
%     -  Definition of \ORACDR as ORAC-DR in small capitals.
%     -  Definition of \FITSref to point to FITS Home Page.
%     -  SST has singled-sided name.
%     -  Added \pagebreak[3] and \goodbreaks to SST to prevent
%     section headings at the foot of a page.
%     -  \markboth in definition of \sstroutine to get running
%     header in reference section.
%     -  Used SUN/95 version of sstitemlist to remove
%     superfluous space after headings.  Added ssthitemlist
%     where the spacing is correct.
%     -  Uses some definitions of degrees, arcminutes,
%     arcsecond, underscore, and a centred asterisk.

%  Things to do:
%     - Example of -calib.

%        Updated for v3.0-2, including new Michelle recipes.
%     2001 December 4 (MJC):
%        Updated for v3.0-3, including new Michelle polarimetry recipes.
%     2002 May 28 (BRADC):
%        Clarified use of calibration options.
%     2002 September 13 (BRADC):
%        232.6: Updated for v3.1-1, including new recipes.
%     2003 May (BRADC):
%        Updated for v4.0, including UIST.
%     2003 June 12 (MJC) 
%        232.7: Added new recipes; revised recipe descriptions, including
%        output data prefixes.  Added section on xoracdr.  Restructured
%        and augmented the Features of the Primitives, including lists

general-purpose automatic data-reduction pipeline environment.  This
document describes its use to reduce imaging data collected at the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) with the UFTI, UIST, IRCAM,
and Michelle instruments, at the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) with
the IRIS2 instrument, from the Very Large Telescope with ISAAC, and
from the Isaac Newton Group using INGRID.  It outlines the algorithms
used and how to make minor modifications of them, and how to correct
for errors made at the telescope.}

%  Name:
%     SST.TEX

%  Purpose:
%     Define LaTeX commands for laying out Starlink routine descriptions.

%  Language:
%     LaTeX

%  Type of Module:
%     LaTeX data file.

%  Description:
%     This file defines LaTeX commands which allow routine documentation
%     produced by the SST application PROLAT to be processed by LaTeX and
%     by LaTeX2html. The contents of this file should be included in the
%     source prior to any statements that make of the sst commnds.

%  Notes:
%     The commands defined in the style file html.sty provided with LaTeX2html
%     are used. These should either be made available by using the appropriate
%     sun.tex (with hypertext extensions) or by putting the file html.sty
%     on your TEXINPUTS path (and including the name as part of the
%     documentstyle declaration).

\section{\xlabel{introduction}Introduction\label{introduction}}

\ORACDR\ is a data-reduction pipeline operating at \UKIRT, \JCMT,
the \AAT.  It is part of the
\htmladdnormallink{ORAC system}{http://www.stsci.edu/stsci/meetings/adassVII/bridgera.html}.
The pipeline reduces and displays multi-frame
observations soon after they are read from the detector.  This allows
observers to assess the quality and suitability of their data in near
real time.  Yet \ORACDR\ is capable of producing publication-quality
results.  

\ORACDR\ is suitable for `offline' data reduction at your home
institution too.  There are many reasons why you may wish to use
\ORACDR\ in this fashion.  For instance, you may have come back from
UKIRT with only the raw observations; or there was an error in a
telescope sequence (formerly an `exec') mixing the groups of
observations; or some data were reduced with a basic algorithm for
speed at the telescope, and now you want to do a more-careful job.
\ORACDR\ is capable of reducing data from instruments not running the
pipeline at their respective telescopes.  Hence \ORACDR\ is available
on Starlink.

\xref{SUN/230}{sun230}{} presents an overview of \ORACDR,
general facilities like its display system, and it explains the
differences between a pipeline and a traditional reduction package.
Put briefly, \ORACDR\ uses a few data headers to direct the data
reduction.  Amongst these headers is the name of a {\em recipe}.  A
recipe is a series of high-level instructions such as ``make a
mosaic'' or ``divide by a flat'' that reduces an {\em observation\/}
comprising one or more data frames.  The implementation of each of
these instructions is through a Perl script---called a
primitive---which calls Starlink packages such as
\xref{\CCDPACK}{sun139}{} and \xref{\KAPPA}{sun95}{},
to actually do the processing of the bulk data.

This document describes how to use \ORACDR\ software on Starlink to
reduce data from the UKIRT imaging instruments: \UFTI, \UIST, \IRCAM, and
\Michelle; the AAT imaging instrument \IRIS; the \ISAAC\ instrument on the
Very Large Telescope (\VLT); and \INGRID\ from the Isaac Newton Group on La Palma.
It outlines the various algorithms used in the recipes, and
includes detailed recipe documentation in the appendix.  Besides the
standard reduction recipes, this manual describes how you can
customise recipes to suit your preferences, and how to correct errors
in the headers of your data frames.

There are complementary documents: \xref{SUN/236}{sun236}{} describes the
\ORACDR\ for spectroscopy from CGS4, Michelle, and UIST; \xref{SUN/246}{sun246}{}
describes the \ORACDR\ for integral field spectroscopy from UIST;
and \xref{SUN/231}{sun231}{} addresses the reduction of SCUBA data with \ORACDR.

% When SUN/234 is ready, remove the above sentence and these comments,
% and uncomment the three lines below.

%\ORACDR\ is not limited to processing UKIRT imaging data.  Complementary
%documents \xref{SUN/231}{sun231}{} and \xref{SUN/234}{sun234}{} address
%the reduction of SCUBA and CGS4 data respectively.

Those wishing wishing to write their own recipes from scratch, or wanting
to apply ORAC-DR to new instruments should consult \xref{SUN/233}{sun233}{}.

\section{\xlabel{using_the_pipeline}Using the pipeline\label{using_the_pipeline}}

\subsection{\xlabel{setting_up_orac-dr}Setting up \ORACDR\label{setting_up_orac-dr}}

Before you can run the pipeline you have to tell \ORACDR\ for which
instrument you wish to reduce data, the observation date, and the
directory containing the raw data, and wher you want the processed
data to be written.  There are two options.

\begin{itemize}

\item  The first needs your data to conform to the directory-naming
convention of the instrument at UKIRT.  This will be the case if you
simply unpack the archive written by the {\bf uktape} utility.  In
this case enter

\begin{verbatim}
      % setenv ORAC_DATA_ROOT <root_data_directory>
      % oracdr_<instrument> <date>
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt $<$root\_data\_directory$>$} is the directory in which you
unpacked the data from the tape, {\tt $<$instrument$>$} is either {\tt
ufti} or {\tt ircam}, and {\tt$<$date$>$} is the UT date in the format
YYYYMMDD.  Note that each \texttt{\%} represents the UNIX shell's
prompt, which you do not type.  The commands must be entered in the
above order.  

For example, the standard location for raw UFTI data is {\tt
raw/ufti/YYYYMMDD/}, and {\tt reduced/ufti/YYYYMMDD/} for the
corresponding reduced data.  So if your data are stored in {\tt
/home/users/abc/data/UKIRT/raw/ufti/20001108/} you should enter the
following.

\begin{verbatim}
      % setenv ORAC_DATA_ROOT  /home/users/abc/data/UKIRT/
      % oracdr_ufti 20001108
\end{verbatim}
to enable the pipeline for \UFTI\ data taken on 2000 November 8.

Data taken from the AAT is handled differently, as there is no unified
directory structure for both raw and reduced data directories. For
IRIS2, INGRID, or ISAAC data the best option is specifying where the
raw and reduced data directories are, as shown below.  ISAAC users
should see
\begin{htmlonly}
\htmlref{ISAAC preliminary conversion.}{isaac_preliminary_conversion}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
Section~\ref{isaac_preliminary_conversion}
\end{latexonly}
for a necessary preliminary naming conversion step.

\item The second option is where your raw and reduced data are to be
in arbitrary directories.  Type the following

\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr_<instrument> <date>
      % setenv ORAC_DATA_IN <raw_data_directory>
      % setenv ORAC_DATA_OUT <reduced_data_directory>
\end{verbatim}

The directories can either be given as full paths, or as relative paths
to the current working directory.  Here is an example for IRCAM data using
full paths.
\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr_ircam 19990328
      % setenv ORAC_DATA_IN /export/data/mjc/asteroid/night1
      % setenv ORAC_DATA_OUT /home/scratch/mjc/reduced
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}
In the first case {\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_IN} and {\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT} are
still defined, but in terms of the root directory.  For instance, re-using
the earlier example with UFTI for UT date 2000 November 8,
{\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_IN} points to {\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_ROOT/raw/ufti/20001108/}.

\ORACDR\ operates in {\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT}, irrespective of
what your current directory is when you invoke it.   Your current
directory remains unchanged.  

It is highly recommended to work in directories on discs local to
the computer running the pipeline.  Processing over NFS-served drives
can many times slower and degrades the performance seen by other users.
Running \ORACDR\ on a Linux computer over NFS-served drives can also
lead to erroneous results, crashing of the pipeline, or computer lockups.

\subsection{\xlabel{raw_data_formats_and_conversions}Raw Data Formats
and Conversions\label{raw_data_formats_and_conversions}}

Raw data take the form of multiple NDFs within an
\xref{HDS container file}{sun92}{} for UKIRT data, or individual
\FITSref\ files
for \AAT, \INGRID\ and \ISAAC\ data.  For \UFTI, \UIST, and \IRCAM they
comprise one NDF for the data array and dynamic headers, such as the
start time of the exposure, and another for static headers.  Each
container file is converted to a single NDF in {\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT}
with a merged set of headers.

The \Michelle\ HDS container file also has NDFs for the individual chop
beams.  However, these cannot be merged until the data variance is
calculated from the individual beams.  Michelle reduced chopped data
become simple NDFs once the recipe takes the difference of the two
beams.

\ORACDR\ automatically converts AAT FITS files into single NDFs in
{\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT} which retain the original FITS headers.
For INGRID, \ORACDR\ converts a multi-extension FITS file into a
multi-NDF HDS container file following UKIRT conventions.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{isaac_preliminary_conversion}ISAAC Preliminary
Conversion\label{isaac_preliminary_conversion}}

Since \ORACDR\ as yet cannot cope with \ISAAC\ file naming, which uses
the UT epoch instead of a sequence number, there is a special C-shell
script which must be invoked once normally before the first \ORACDR\
initialisation.  If you enter

\begin{verbatim}
      % isaac2oracdr
\end{verbatim}
in a directory containing ISAAC FITS files, the command converts them
into NDFs with names adhering to the UKIRT convention.  The earliest
file has observation number 1, and the observation number increments
for each FITS file in time order.  The script copes with files names
in either the raw or archive nomenclature.  It copes with data from
more than one night in a given directory, assigning each night its own
sequence of observation numbers; and it uses a common UT date for
observations in a single night spanning midnight UT. You should put
all both the calibration and target files for a given night in the
same directory.

\subsection{\xlabel{running_the_pipeline}Running the
pipeline\label{running_the_pipeline}}

To run the pipeline, you use the {\bf oracdr} command.  This has a
number of qualifiers described fully in \xref{SUN/230}{sun230}{oracdr}.
There is online help too; enter

\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr -h
\end{verbatim}
for a list of the options.

Unlike using \ORACDR\ at \UKIRT, you are unlikely to need the looping ({\tt -loop}
option) for offline processing, as all the data exist.  Thus the most
important qualifiers are {\tt -list} and {\tt -from}, which specify
the frames to process; and the recipe name.

\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr -from 42
\end{verbatim}
will process frames f20001108\_00042 until the end of the night's data
(assuming the earlier {\bf oracdr\_ufti} command), running the recipes
given by each frame's header (RECIPE keyword).  More likely is that
you provide a list of selected observations.  The following example

\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr -list 41:49,51:59 JITTER_SELF_FLAT
\end{verbatim}
processes frames from 41 to 49 inclusive and 51 to 59 inclusive,
invoking the \htmlref{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT}{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT} recipe,
and overriding the RECIPE header.

\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr -list 5:7,23,33
\end{verbatim}
would reduce the frames 5, 6, 7, 23, and 33.  This is most likely
to be applicable to a series of dark frames.

There is a hazard with the {\tt -list} option.  Take care to select a
complete set of frames associated with an observation.  A common error
is to include accidently a dark frame not part of the group.  Check
the log in the raw data directory; it has file extension {\tt
.nightlog}.  If you do not have a log, it is easy to create one.
\label{night_log}

\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr -noeng -from 1 -skip -nodisplay NIGHT_LOG
\end{verbatim}
This will create a log called {\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_IN/$<$date$>$.nightlog}
for the current UT date. For multi-mode instruments such as Michelle, UIST,
IRIS2, or ISAAC, the log will be called \goodbreak {\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_IN/$<$date$>$\_im.nightlog}.

\subsection{\xlabel{graphical_initialisation_and_operation}Graphical initialisation and
operation\label{graphical_initialisation_and_operation}}

You may prefer the \ORACDR\ graphical interface called 
\xref{{\bf xoracdr}}{sun230}{xoracdr}.
\latexonly{( See SUN/230.)}  It allows you to configure
ORAC-DR: set the instrument, UT date, raw and reduced directories; and
to run the pipeline with the various options.  It permits monitoring
of the primitives during execution of a recipe. {\bf xoracdr} offers
access to other facilities like
\htmlref{display control}{display} and recipe editing.  The in-built
documentation does not pertain to the GUI itself but to general
\ORACDR\ information, however, {\bf xoracdr} is straightforward to use
and explore.  While {\bf xoracdr} has some rough edges, it is popular
with many users.  To try it, enter

\begin{verbatim}
      % xoracdr &
\end{verbatim}

Once the tool appears, you should select an instrument from the menu on
the left, a UT date in the top centre, and raw and reduced directories
to the lower right.   The {\tt From:} and {\tt To:} refer to the
observation numbers to process.  When you are ready to reduce data,
click on the {\tt Start ORAC-DR} button.

\subsection{\xlabel{display}Display\label{display}}

\ORACDR\ optionally lets you inspect the raw frames, and the processed
data as they are created.  There is a variety of graphical
methods available, including histograms and contour plots, if you
choose a \xref{\KAPPA}{sun95}{} GWM widget.  Most people prefer a
simple scaled image display with \xref{\GAIA}{sun214}{}.  This offers
facilities to inspect and analyse the data, and both pixel and sky
co-ordinates of the cursor position are presented.  The selection of
frame types to display, where they should appear, and how they are
scaled are configurable using a simple text file or a special GUI tool
{\bf oracdisp}.  See \xref{SUN/230}{sun230}{display_system} for details
and examples.

Processing offline, there is less need to see the data displayed in real time.
If you wish to accelerate the processing switch off the display option.

\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr -nodisplay ...
\end{verbatim}

If you do want to display a recommendation is to create two GAIA windows
displaying images using autoscaled limits.  This first could be for
raw and flat-fielded data, and the second for the mosaics.  You are
likely to want to interact with the latter, using \GAIA's toolboxes.
Your {\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT/disp.dat} could look like this.

\begin{verbatim}
      # Send raw frame to first GAIA window 
      num type=image tool=gaia region=0 window=0 autoscale=1 zautoscale=1

      # Send flatfielded frame to first GAIA window.
      ff  type=image tool=gaia region=0 window=0 autoscale=1 zautoscale=1

      # Send mosaic frame to second GAIA window.
      mos type=image tool=gaia region=0 window=1 autoscale=1 zautoscale=1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{\xlabel{calibration_information}Calibration Information\label{calibration_information}}

\ORACDR\ records calibration information, such as dark frames, flat
fields, and the read noise, within index files, one for each type of
calibration information.  When the pipeline needs a calibration frame
it searches the index file for the best matching entry subject to a
set of rules. Each recipe reports the calibrations it has used.  If no
suitable calibration exists, the pipeline exits with an error message
stating this fact.  For further details see
\xref{SUN/230}{sun230}{calibration_selection}.
\begin{htmlonly}
Here is an 
\htmlref{example index file.}{index_files}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
Section~\ref{index_files} has an example of an index file.
\end{latexonly}

You can also select a specific calibration using the {\tt -calib}
command-line option, provided the chosen calibration has an entry
in the appropriate index file.  See
\begin{latexonly}
the section on
\end{latexonly}
\xref{calibration options}{sun230}{calibration_options}
\begin{latexonly}
in SUN/230
\end{latexonly}
for details and examples.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{available_calib}Available calibration methods\label{available_calib}}

The following calibration methods are available for imaging recipes.

\begin{itemize}

\item baseshift --- Use the given comma-separated doublet ({\em{i.e.}}\ {\tt 0,0}) as the
frame's base position.  This is used to locate faint sources in the
mid-infra-red data where centroiding fails when there is some
telescope pointing error (such as incorrect instrument apertures).  It
is calibrated within \htmlref{NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT}{NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT} on a
bright standard, and used by
\htmlref{NOD\_CHOP\_FAINT}{NOD\_CHOP\_FAINT}.  For a well-tuned
system, the baseshift is expected to be near 0,0, so the centre of the
detector is at the reference position (derived from the FITS headers).

\item bias --- Use the given bias frame.

\item dark --- Use the given dark frame.

\item flat --- Use the given flat frame.

\item mask --- Use the given bad-pixel mask.

\item readnoise --- Use the given value for the detector readnoise in
electrons.

\item referenceoffset --- Use the comma-separated doublet
({\em{i.e.}}\ {\tt 0,0}) as the frame's reference offset, which is 
difference between the frame centre and the reference pixel derived
from the FITS headers.

\item rotation --- Use the given frame as a rotation matrix.  This is
no longer used in the imaging recipes.

\item sky --- Use the given sky frame.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\xlabel{log_files}Log files\label{log_files}}

In addition to presenting the progressing data reduction to an
\ORACDR\ X-window, \ORACDR, by default, retains a copy of the
processing steps and errors in a log file.  These logs are important
if something has gone wrong, and you have exited the X-window.
Information from the applications software can be included if you run
the pipeline with the {\tt -verbose} command-line option.  Logs also
serve as a record of the data processing.  Yet the log files are often
overlooked because they are hidden.  The log file is called
{\tt\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT/.oracdr\_$<$number$>$}, where {\tt$<$number$>$}
is the current process identification.  The {\tt -log f} option to the
{\bf oracdr} command enables log-file creation.

See \xref{SUN/230}{sun230}{windows_and_output} for details of the
logging options.

\section{\xlabel{features_of_the_primitives}Features of the
Primitives\label{features_of_the_primitives}}

Primitives are the Perl scripts which actually call the applications
to do most of the data processing.  All of the imaging recipes are, in
principle, independent of the instrument.  However, some recipes are
inappropriate; for example, the NOD\_CHOP family of recipes are
intended for mid-IR imaging with Michelle, but not the
\htmlref{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT}{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT} family.  The generality
comes in part from translations of relevant header information into a
generic form used by \ORACDR.

Not all the following steps apply to all recipes.  Consult the
\htmlref{reference section}{recipes} to see summaries for each recipe.
The steps are presented in normal order of appearance.

The main primitives pertinent to each step are listed in bracketed
italics, should you wish to tailor the recipes.  These are found in
{\tt\$ORAC\_DIR/imaging} tree, unless they start with {\em general/}
when they are located in {\tt\$ORAC\_DIR/general}.  Note the some may
be instrument-specific variants, either given explicitly or with the
{\em$<$instrument$>$} token, which means substitute the instrument
name in uppercase. 

While those listed form the bulk of the primitives, there are many not
listed here, mostly those for
\begin{htmlonly}
\htmlref{recipe initialisation}{hello_primitives} called
$<$recipe$>$\_HELLO\_.
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
recipe initialisation called $<$recipe$>$\_HELLO\_ (see
Section~\ref{hello_primitives} for more information),
\end{latexonly}
and for 
\begin{htmlonly}
\htmlref{recipe steering}{steering_primitive}, which
control when to perform certain operations, called
$<$recipe$>$\_STEER\_.
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
recipe steering which control when to perform certain operations, called
$<$recipe$>$\_STEER\_ (see Section~\ref{steering_primitive}).
\end{latexonly}
The first of these is normally left unchanged unless there is a need
to add more steering parameters passed to the steering primitive.  The
steering primitive itself is only modified for such new steering
parameters, and if the observing pattern or sequence is different from
what the recipe is programmed to expect.  Other primitives not
mentioned here are tied closely with single recipes, usually to create
and file calibrations.

\subsection{\xlabel{preparation_of_single_frames}Preparation of Single
Frames\label{preparation_of_single_frames}}

{\em[\_IMAGING\_HELLO\_, $<$instrument$>$/\_INSTRUMENT\_HELLO\_,\\
\_PREPARE\_SINGLE\_FRAME\_]}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{manipulation_of_raw_data}Manipulation of Raw
Data\label{manipulation_of_raw_data}}

The first stage makes an NDF or multiple NDFs stored in an
\xref{HDS}{sun92}{} container file in {\tt\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT}, the actual
operation depending on the instrument.  In some cases like \UFTI, this
is dealt by the \ORACDR\ infrastructure, including conversion from
\FITSref\ for early UFTI data.  \newline {\em[$<$instrument$>$/\_CREATE\_RAW\_]}

For \IRCAM\ the recipes are merely copying the raw NDF, because the
original raw files are normally write protected.

\UIST\ and \Michelle\ both copy all the components of multi-NDF container
file.  These container files have a HEADER NDF of the observation-wide
FITS headers, and NDFs of chopped beams or integrations.  Recipes
check that two integrations are present for a chopped observations or
one integration for other modes, exiting with an error message if
either test fails.  A single integration NDF is merged with the HEADER
NDF into a simple NDF.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{preliminaries}Preliminaries\label{preliminaries}}

There are a few operations applied to all frames.  First the raw frame
may be displayed.  \newline {\em[general/\_DISPLAY\_FRAME\_IMAGE\_]}

Recipes remove any \xref{AXIS and blank TITLE components}{sun95}{ap_NDFformat}; 
the latter to preserve the object name when NDFs are exported to
\FITSref.  Next they set the origin of the frame so that frame pixels retain the detector
pixel indices.  It then becomes possible to use a full-sized bad-pixel
mask or flat field on any subset of a detector's pixel grid.
\newline {\em[\_REMOVE\_AXES\_, \_REMOVE\_BLANK\_TITLE\_, \_SET\_ORIGIN\_]}

Then recipes determine the displacements of the reference pixel with
respect to the centre of the frame and stores the displacements in the
referenceshift \htmlref{calibration system}{calibration_information}.
The reference pixel is where a star would be placed for photometry or
the centre of a chopped and nodded pattern.
\newline {\em[\_SET\_REFERENCE\_PIXEL\_OFFSET\_, \_GET\_FRAME\_CENTRE\_]}

The next step is to switch on history recording.  It is recommended to
leave this enabled, since it provides a record of the processing steps
of your final mosaics.  Otherwise the pipeline becomes something of 
a black box.  Use the \KAPPA\ command
\xref{{\bf hislist}}{sun95}{HISLIST} to list the history records.
\newline {\em[\_TURN\_ON\_HISTORY\_]}

For Michelle there is a validation check of the waveform used,
comparing the waveform name given in the headers with other metadata,
and recipes issue a warning if there is an inconsistency.  Also the
data range is validated to be between 25000--48000.
\newline {\em[MICHELLE/\_CHECK\_WAVEFORM\_, MICHELLE/\_VALIDATE\_RAW\_DATA\_]}

For UIST data taken before 2002 December 2 and Michelle, raw data
units are converted from ADU per second to the \UKIRT\ standard of total
ADU per exposure.
\newline {\em[$<$instrument$>$/\_INSTRUMENT\_HELLO\_, UIST/\_DATA\_UNITS\_TO\_ADU\_]}

A \htmlref{night log}{night_log} is created or appended in {\tt\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT}
for each frame processed.  This tabulates the main parameters of the
observation having first corrected defective or undefined headers.
\newline {\em[\_NIGHT\_LOG\_, UIST/\_NIGHT\_LOG\_,
$<$instrument$>$/\_FIX\_HEADERS\_ for MICHELLE, IRCAM, and UFTI]}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{non-linearity_correction}Non-linearity
Correction\label{non-linearity_correction}}

Detector non-linearity corrections are applied to \IRCAM\ and \INGRID.
For IRCAM the correction is $3.3\times10^{-6}$ times the square of the
bias-subtracted signal.  For INGRID the measured-to-actual counts is
given by the expression  $1.0 - 1.2247 \times 10^{-6} * M - 7.68045 \times 10^{-11} * M^2$,
where {\em{M}} is the measured ADU count, although it is actually
applied after the pre-exposure readout is subtracted from the
post-exposure integration. \newline {\em[IRCAM/\_CORRECT\_NONLINEARITY\_,\\
INGRID/\_CORRECT\_NONLINEARITY\_PRE\_POST\_]}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{electronic_ghosting}Electronic Ghosting\label{electronic_ghosting}}

For \ISAAC\ there is a correction applied for electronic ghosting. The
ghosts consist ``of an additional signal, which, on one row, is
proportional to the sum of the intensity along this row and the row
512 rows away.'' according to the \htmladdnormallink{{\em ISAAC Data
Reduction Guide}}{http://www.eso.org/instruments/isaac/drg/html/drg.html}.
Recipes combine the two halves adding the bottom half to the top and
vice versa, collapse this image along rows, scale by the documented
correction factor of 1.35E-5 to form the ghost flux per row, which is
then subtracted from the original image.
\newline {\em[ISAAC/\_REMOVE\_ELECTRONIC\_GHOSTING\_]}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{bad_pixels}Bad pixels\label{bad_pixels}}

The recipes apply a predetermined bad-pixel mask with the aim of
removing the bulk of `hot' and `cold' pixels.  This flags
approximately 1.0\% of \INGRID, 0.7\% of \UFTI\ pixels, 0.4\% of \UIST\ and
\ISAAC\ pixels, 0.1\% of \IRCAM\ and \IRIS\ pixels, and a preliminary 12 of
{\Michelle}'s pixels.
\newline {\em[\_MASK\_BAD\_PIXELS\_]}

There are two problems.  First, the pre-calculated mask only accounts
for 95\% of UFTI's problem pixels.  The \htmladdnormallink{other 5\%
are occasionally deviant on timescales of
days}{http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/UKIRT/instruments/ufti/badpixels.html}.
The variability of IRCAM, Michelle, UIST, and IRIS2 bad pixels is
unknown at the time of writing.  In addition the bad-pixel masks have
not been regularly monitored prior to 2000 August.  The result is that
non-physical values could appear in the processed data, some as
extreme as $-10^{-31}$ causing automatic registration and image
display to go awry.

Therefore, after \htmlref{dark subtraction}{dark_subtraction}, recipes
apply thresholding which flags non-physical values as bad, meaning
undefined.  This is just augmenting the bad-pixel mask, and no valid
data are lost.  The upper limit is above the nominal saturation
levels: 15000 for UFTI; 20000 for UIST; 20000 for IRCAM in STARE or
NDSTARE mode, and 33000 using the Deepwell; 100000 for Michelle;
200000 for IRIS2 and ISAAC; and 30000 for INGRID.  The lower limit is
the 2-, 3-, 3-$\sigma$-clipped mean, approximating to the mode, less
five times the clipped standard deviation, $\sigma$.  While a positive
threshold looks attractive, small negative values, while appearing
non-physical, can arise through noise.  Therefore, to avoid a bias
(mainly in the $J$ band), a further constraint is that the lower limit
lies in the range $-$100 to 1.
\newline {\em[\_SUBTRACT\_DARK\_, $<$instrument$>$/\_GET\_SATURATION\_LEVEL\_]}

Recipes issue warnings if the dark-subtracted frame's mode is
negative, allowing for the error in the mode.  It aborts with an error
message if the modal dark-subtracted signal is more than one standard
deviation negative.  These states usually arise because of an aberrant
dark.

\paragraph{\xlabel{create_bad-pixel_mask}Creating a bad-pixel 
mask\label{create_bad-pixel_mask}}

The easiest way to create your own bad-pixel mask for use with the
calibration system, is to run the \htmlref{MAKE\_BPM}{MAKE\_BPM}
recipe on a long-exposure dark (at least 20 seconds integration).  It
is possible to change the symmetric $\sigma$-clipping bounds in the
recipe (see primitive {\tt\_MAKE\_BPM\_BY\_SIGMA\_THRESHOLDING\_}).
You can tailor this primitive if you want more control, say to have
asymmetric rejection or more sophisticated definitions.
\newline {\em[\_MAKE\_BPM\_BY\_SIGMA\_THRESHOLDING\_]}

For better results, use the average of long dark frames taken across
two or three nights.  First, produce QUICK\_LOOK versions of the
long-exposure dark to flatten the NDF structure or convert the FITS
file.  Flag all pixels that are 5 standard deviations ($\sigma$) above
and below the 3-$\sigma$ clipped mean of the dark as ``bad'', then
multiply the resulting frame by zero so that the resulting bad-pixel
mask has data values of {\tt 0} and {\tt bad} only.  You can choose your
own thresholds.  Here is an example, using data from two nights of
UFTI data and Starlink software.

\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr_ufti 20010101
      % setenv ORAC_DATA_OUT `pwd`
      % oracdr -list 4:4 QUICK_LOOK -nodisplay
      % oracdr_ufti 20010102
      % setenv ORAC_DATA_OUT `pwd`
      % oracdr -list 4:4 QUICK_LOOK -nodisplay
 
      % kappa
      % add f20010101_00004_raw f20010102_00004_raw add_darks
      % cmult add_darks 0.5 av_darks
      % stats av_dark clip=3
      % thresh av_darks av_darks_thresh -49 58 bad bad
      % cmult av_darks_thresh 0 avbpm title=\"UFTI bpm, January 2001\"
\end{verbatim}

In the above example the 3-$\sigma$ clipped mean was 4.27 and the standard deviation
was 10.727, resulting in $-$49 and 58 as the lower and upper thresholds.

Then you specify the bad-pixel mask on the command line.
\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr -calib mask=avbpm ...
\end{verbatim}

\UIST\ has its own slightly different formula; see \htmlref{DARK\_AND\_BPM}{DARK\_AND\_BPM}
for details.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{data_variance}Data Variance\label{data_variance}}

There is optional data variance creation for all instruments.  By
default only the polarimetry and mid-infra-red NOD\_CHOP family of
recipes have variance processing enabled.  To switch on variance
calculations for the other recipes is a simple edit of the recipe.  See
\begin{latexonly}
Section~\ref{switch_on_data_variance} for instructions.
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
the notes on
\htmlref{customising recipes}{switch_on_data_variance}
for instructions.
\end{htmlonly}

The initial variance is calculated as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item
First the readnoise variance for the instrument is applied.  It is
currently a constant for all pixels, which takes the gain, the number
of exposures, and the number of array reads per exposure into account.
For more than one read, $n$, the noise scales by the following factor,

\[   \sqrt{(n(n+1))/(12(n-1))} \]

which is derived from linear-regression theory.
The read noise reduces by the factor $1/\sqrt{\rm{number~of~exposures}}$.
\newline {\em[\_ADD\_READNOISE\_VARIANCE\_]}

The raw read noise in units of electrons comes from the readnoise calibration
(set within the \htmlref{ARRAY\_TESTS}{ARRAY\_TESTS}) recipe, or
should one not exist, \ORACDR\ selects a representative default.
The \UFTI\ and \IRCAM\ defaults come from the instrument Web pages such as 
\begin{htmlonly}
\htmladdnormallink{this}{http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/UKIRT/instruments/ufti/PARAMETERS.html}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
{\tt http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/UKIRT/instruments/ufti/PARAMETERS.html}
\end{latexonly}
and depend on speed, gain, and read type.  Typical values are as
follows: \UFTI\ 26$e^{-}$, \UIST\ 40$e^{-}$, \IRCAM\ 47$e^{-}$, \IRIS\
15$e^{-}$, \ISAAC\ 18.5$e^{-}$, and \INGRID\ 25$e^{-}$.  \Michelle\ reductions
merely use an estimate of 1000$e^{-}$. 
\newline {\em[$<$instrument$>$/\_GET\_READNOISE\_]}

The gain---the number of electrons per analogue-to-digital
unit---comes from the data headers.  If for some unusual reason, the
header is absent, the recipe subsitutes suitable time-dependent
defaults.  The gain is $\sim$6$e^{-}$ for UFTI and IRCAM, but
500$e^{-}$ for Michelle, 15$e^{-}$ for UIST, $\sim$5$e^{-}$ for IRIS2,
4.6$e^{-}$ for ISAAC, and 4.1$e^{-}$ for INGRID.
\newline {\em[$<$instrument$>$/\_GET\_GAIN\_]}

\item
The second step is to add the Poisson variance.  This simply adds the
data array to the variance component taking into account the gain of
the detector and the number of exposures. 

For read modes where the bias level is not removed, such as CHOP or
STARE, a bias \htmlref{calibration}{calibration_information} frame
must be subtracted first.  If no suitable bias is found, the bias is
deemed to be zero; \ORACDR\ issues a warning that the variance is
wrong, likely overestimated.

The calculations also derive the ratio of the read noise to the Poisson
noise, and reports the percentage of background-limited pixels, {\em
i.e.}\ those where the Poisson noise is greater than the read noise.
\newline {\em[\_ADD\_POISSON\_VARIANCE\_]}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{bias_subtraction}Bias subtraction\label{bias_subtraction}}

In most cases there is no bias to subtract.  Recipes attempt to remove
a bias frame only if the data have variance information and were taken
using a non-ND mode ({\em{i.e.}}\ where the bias has not already been
subtracted in the instrument data system), whereupon a bias frame, if
available, is subtracted; if, however, there is no bias calibration
the recipe issues a warning issued that the computed variances may be
wrong.  This step occurs between the creation of the readnoise
variance and adding the Poisson variance.
\newline {\em[\_REMOVE\_BIAS\_]}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{chopping}Chopping\label{chopping}}

In the thermal and mid-infra-red regimes the sky is varying so rapidly
normal reduction methods are inappropriate.  Instead sky subtraction
is achieved either by frequently oscillating the secondary mirror
between two beams (mid-infra-red), called A and B; or moving the
telescope offsets (thermal) after a short exposure.  The generic term
is {\em chopping}.  The former are reduced by the
\htmlref{NOD\_CHOP}{NOD\_CHOP} recipes, and the latter by the
\htmlref{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK}{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK} recipes.

Both methods produce frames with the target image at different
positions on the detector.  The aforementioned recipes difference
these pairs of frames, so that the result has both a positive and
negative image, and a background level close to zero.  The sense of
the subtraction is always the same.  \ORACDR\ subtracts the B beam
from the A beam, and the normal sequence is ABBA.  For the thermal
data, the chopped beam is only notional, but the same terminology
and subtraction sense is used.
\newline {\em[\_DIFFERENCE\_PAIR\_, \_DIFFERENCE\_CHOP\_BEAMS\_]}

If the telescope is further offset (nodded), the final mosaic of the
differenced frames can have two positive and two negative
representations of the source.  In practice the thermal reductions
register and co-add the nodded frames to compensate for flat-field
errors in \IRCAM.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{post-pre_subtraction}Post-pre subtraction\label{post-pre_subtraction}}

Raw \INGRID\ data comprise a pre-exposure image and a post-exposure
integration.  The pipeline subtracts the former from the latter to
give the measured signal.
\newline {\em[INGRID/\_DIFFERENCE\_PRE\_POST\_]}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{fits_headers}FITS headers\label{fits_headers}}

For historical reasons, \IRCAM\ headers prior to 
\htmladdnormallink{ORAC}{http://www.stsci.edu/stsci/meetings/adassVII/bridgera.html}
were somewhat jumbled, disorganised, and some violated the 
\htmladdnormallink{FITS standard}{http://archive.stsci.edu/fits/fits_standard/}.
The pipeline corrects, orders and structures the headers to help
the human reader locate information quickly, and allow complete 
conversion to FITS.

For IRCAM, \Michelle, and \UFTI, even since ORAC came online, the raw
headers do not provide a sky co-ordinate system.  \IRIS\ also has an
incomplete sky co-ordinate system supplied in the raw headers.  Using
information in the raw headers, the pipeline creates a FITS world
co-ordinate system using a tangent plane projection in the 
\htmladdnormallink{AIPS
convention}{http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/aips27.ps}---this
is quite adequate given the small fields of
view---which it imports into the NDF's WCS component.  Thus
\xref{\GAIA}{sun214}{} and \xref{\KAPPA}{sun95}{} can display these
co-ordinates on overlay grids and axes.  For all these, such as
{\KAPPA}'s {\bf display} with axes, you may need to select the
appropriate astrometric Frame like this.

\begin{verbatim}
     % wcsframe <your_NDF> frame=sky
\end{verbatim}
where you substitute your NDF's name for {\tt$<$your\_NDF$>$}.  The
mosaics from the pipeline should already have the sky domain set.
\INGRID\ headers are also revised by the pipeline into an AIPS system.
\newline {\em[$<$instrument$>$/\_CREATE\_WCS\_, $<$instrument$>$/\_GET\_PLATE\_SCALE\_]}

Note that the reference pixel of the equatorial co-ordinates in the
raw headers was until recently only known to a few arcseconds, but now
should be of the order of 0.5 arcseconds.  The pipeline sets empirical
reference pixels now matched by the telescope control system; see
primitive \_CREATE\_WCS\_ for details.  For critical work, you should
tie in your frames with online catalogues, as available through \GAIA.

\subsection{\xlabel{dark_subtraction}Dark subtraction\label{dark_subtraction}}

This is as simple as it sounds.  The dark frame selected through the
\htmlref{calibration system}{calibration_information} must have the same
exposure time and read type as the object frames.  There is no dark
subtraction for chopped data as processed by the
\htmlref{NOD\_CHOP}{NOD\_CHOP} collection
of recipes, as the differencing of nodded pairs of frames makes the
operation unnecessary.  \newline {\em[\_SUBTRACT\_DARK\_]}

\subsection{\xlabel{flat-fielding}Flat-fielding\label{flat-fielding}}

Some recipes create their own flats from the observations themselves,
called a self flat, or sky frames within a sequence that dithers to
sky, or use a separate observation of a jitter on sky.  (There is no
support for internal calibrations or dome flats in the recipes.)
Whenever a flat is required, recipes access the flat calibration index
to find the most recent flat matching the required attributes such as
filter.

The current recipes for Michelle mid-infra-red observations do not
create or use flat fields.

Creating a flat can be an iterative procedure, involving cleaning,
making a first guess, object masking, proper normalisation, and making
an improved flat.  There are some primitives to bundle the operations
including division by the flat-field.  
\newline {\em[\_FLAT\_FIELD\_MASKED\_GROUP\_, \_FLAT\_FIELD\_QUADRANT\_JITTER\_,\\
\_FLAT\_FIELD\_NCOLOUR\_,  \_DIVIDE\_BY\_FLAT\_,
\_DIVIDE\_BY\_FLAT\_FROM\_GROUP\_]}

There are variants for certain families of recipes, which marshall the
various required subgroups of frames before dividing by the flat-field.
\newline {\em[\_DIVIDE\_BY\_FLAT\_CHOP\_SKY\_, \_DIVIDE\_BY\_FLAT\_FROM\_EXTENDED\_,\\
\_DIVIDE\_BY\_FLAT\_NOD\_PAIRS\_]}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{flat_creation}Flat creation\label{flat_creation}}

Frames are optionally cleaned to remove extreme outliers ($\pm$3 or
6$\sigma$ about the mean in 15$\times$15-pixel neighbourhood) iterated
three times, except for thermal recipes
\begin{latexonly}
NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_\-MASK
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly} 
\htmlref{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK}{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK}
\end{htmlonly}
and variants, and \htmlref{NOD\_SKY\_FLAT\_THERMAL}{NOD\_SKY\_FLAT\_THERMAL}. 
The data are then normalised, combined pixel by pixel using a broadened median,
and the combined array normalised to a have a mean of one.  It is possible to
use another statistic for the combination, such as a clipped median.
\newline {\em[\_MAKE\_FLAT\_FROM\_GROUP\_,

Flats are filed with the calibration system.  \newline {\em[\_FILE\_FLAT\_]}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{object_masking}Object masking\label{object_masking}}

In recipes which make a flat using the frames taken of the targets,
the so-called self flat, any sources present can bias the flat field,
and result in blotchy mosaics.  The full versions of such recipes, as
opposed to the \_BASIC versions, and
\htmlref{SKY\_FLAT\_MASKED}{SKY\_FLAT\_MASKED} greatly reduce
these artifacts using the following algorithm.  After the application
of the approximate self-flat field, an \EXTRACTOR\ inventory is made
of objects having at least 12 connected pixels above 1.0 $\sigma$
above sky.  The locations, shapes, orientations and sizes are used to
make a mask. The mask is applied to the dark-subtracted frames and a
new flat created.  As the outer parts of bright objects often leave
residual unmasked blobs, a circular central occulting mask is used.
The diameter is normally 7 arcseconds, but it can be adjusted through
the OCCULT argument of primitive \_MAKE\_OBJECTS\_MASK\_.  In the
\htmlref{QUADRANT\_JITTER}{QUADRANT\_JITTER} recipe the central mask's
diameter equals the length of the shorter side of a quadrant.  The
disadvantage is that the noise is higher within the occulted circle,
and its variance is non-uniform across the central ninth of the mosaic.
You can modify the the central mask size and shape; see primitives 
\_FLAT\_FIELD\_QUADRANT\_JITTER\_ and \_MAKE\_OBJECTS\_MASK\_.
\newline {\em[\_MAKE\_OBJECTS\_MASK\_, \_MASK\_OBJECTS\_,
\_DEFINE\_QUADRANT\_MASKS\_,\\
\_MASK\_QUADRANT\_]}

After masking biases can be introduced as the objects or masks move to
different locations on the detector each with a different response in
the flat field.  This is most pronounced for QUADRANT\_JITTER where a
quadrant of the detector is masked, and IRCAM2 which had a strongly
sloping response. in which the mean flat is considerably different
from the remaining quadrants.  Merely taking a median at each pixel
will preferentially select values from certain frames.  Thus there has
to be an allowance for these systematic differences before the data
are combined to give representative relative intensities.  The first
frame becomes a reference frame against which the recipes scales the
modal values of the other frames.
\newline {\em[\_NORMALISE\_TO\_MODE\_, \_NORMALISE\_TO\_MODE\_EXTENDED\_,\\
\_CLIPPED\_STATS\_]}

The improved flat typically shows a uniformity at $\sim$0.02\% of the
sky. It is this flat which produces the flat-field frames for
mosaicking.  Systematic errors in the sky---a major uncertainty in
infra-red point-source photometry---are also reduced significantly by
this algorithm.

\xref{\EXTRACTOR}{sun226}{} on occasions underestimate the sizes of objects,
so there is an enlargement factor from 1.0--1.5, defaulting to 1.0, applied in
primitive \_MAKE\_OBJECTS\_MASK\_.  If you find residual dark rings in
your flat-fielded images, try adjusting the ENLARGE argument either in
the recipe or the primitive default.  See 
\begin{latexonly}

\subsection{\xlabel{field-distortion_correction}Field-distortion Correction
\label{field-distortion_correction}}

The \ISAAC\ instrument exhibits \htmladdnormallink{field distortion}
{http://www.eso.org/instruments/isaac/problems_tips.html} amounting to
2.5 pixels in the corners of the detector.  If not corrected, mosaics
with large dithers have multiple images in the overlap regions.
Therefore recipes resample the image applying the published polynomial
mapping.  This correction also improves the registration.
\newline {\em[ISAAC/\_DEFINE\_DISTORTION\_TRANSFORMATION\_,\\
ISAAC/\_APPLY\_DISTORTION\_TRANSFORMATION\_]}

\subsection{\xlabel{bias_variation}Bias variation\label{bias_variation}}

The bias in the ISAAC short-wavelength camera depends upon the detected
flux.  Thus in target frames there is a residual bias not fully
corrected by bias subtraction evident as two steepening ramps
downwards to rows 1 and 513.  An ISAAC-variant recipe corrects for this
as follows.  First within a flat-fielded frame they locate sources and
mask them (as described in
\begin{latexonly}
Section~\ref{object_masking})
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
\htmlref{earlier)}{object_masking}
\end{htmlonly}
Then it forms a one-dimensional profile by collapsing along rows
using the median, from which it subtracts a clipped mean of
the profile to form a new profile of the bias variations.
The bias-variation profile is then subtracted from each row of the
original flat-fielded frame.
\newline {\em[ISAAC/\_BIAS\_CORRECT\_GROUP\_]}

\subsection{\xlabel{sky_subtraction}Sky Subtraction\label{sky_subtraction}}

In general the recipes do not sky-subtract in the literal sense of
pixel-by-pixel subtraction of a sky frame, or better of some median of
jittered sky or even target frames.  Such recipes could readily be
created if there is a demand.  Instead the sky signature is usually
accounted for in the \htmlref{flat-fielding}{flat-fielding}.
Therefore the mosaics generally have the sky signature removed, but
not base level.

The sky varies rapidly in the thermal and mid-infra-red, so dithered
pairs, or nodded and dithered pairs respectively are differenced to
attempt to remove the sky signature.  See
\begin{latexonly}
Section~\ref{chopping}.
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
the section on \htmlref{chopping}{chopping}.
\end{htmlonly}
\newline {\em[\_DIFFERENCE\_PAIR\_]}

Another recipe which performs a pixel-by-pixel sky subtraction is
\htmlref{SKY\_AND\_JITTER}{SKY\_AND\_JITTER}.  It's hardly used and
not recommended because it demands a very stable sky, since only one
sky frame is observed at the start of the observation; and a region of
sky devoid of objects to avoid `holes' appearing in the subtracted
target frames.
\newline {\em[\_SUBTRACT\_SKY\_SKY\_AND\_JITTER\_]}

Another form of sky subtraction is to remove a representative sky
level.  This benefits imaging of extended sources whose scale exceeds
the dither pattern or even the detector's field of view.  The normal
procedure is to alternate between dithered integrations on target and
a region of sky.  The representative statistic is a multiply clipped
mean at 2, 2.5, 3, then 3 standard deviations, which effectively gives
the mode, and so is not biased by resolved sources.  At present the
\htmlref{CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER}{CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER} and
\htmlref{EXTENDED\_$n\times$$m$}{EXTENDED\_5x5} recipes take the average
of the modes of bracketted sky frames.  For offline processing it
would be possible to fit a spline, say, to the modes and provide a
better subtraction.  Under normal conditions, where the sky level is
not varying rapidly or suddenly because of cirrus, the algorithm works
well, especially over longer integrations.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{polarimetry_extraction_and_sky_subtraction}Polarimetry 
Extraction and Sky Subtraction\label{polarimetry_extraction_and_sky_subtraction}}

The polarimetry recipes are designed to work with a Wollaston prism.
This divides the signal into four partitions.  These are ordinary and
extraordinary beams (usually abbreviated to e and o beams) for the
target and a region of nearby sky.  Thus the raw data comprise four
strips with an aspect ratio of about 6.

These partitions are normally separated by a mask, but the recipes do
not depend on having the mask to extract the various regions say by
detecting the edges.  For each instrument the pixel limits of each
region are fixed.  The current target limits are 30\% to 70\% of the
width of the long axis of each region to allow for some reasonable
dithering of point sources, since there are usually only three jitter
positions, while making mosaics with few pixels not derived from all
contributing jittered frames.  For extended sources these limits
change to 10\% to 90\% to include as much object as possible with
smaller dithers and alternating to blank-sky regions.  Thus the limits
define a section 40\% or 80\% of the width of the frame, roughly
centred on the source.  The limits on the sky regions are 1\% to 99\% of
the frame width, mainly to avoid unreliable and pathological pixels at
the detector's edge.
\newline {\em[$<$instrument$>$/\_DEFINE\_POL\_REGIONS\_]}

The recipes extract the target regions into e- and o-beam frames.  The
modes (the means after clipping at 2, 3, 3 standard deviations) of the
e- and o-beam sky regions are subtracted from their corresponding
target beam, incorporating the uncertainty of each sky level in the
corresponding target beam's variance array.  For an extended-source
observation, the sky levels are determined from the two corresponding
regions for each beam in the following sky frame.
\newline {\em[\_SUBTRACT\_SKY\_POL, \_SUBTRACT\_SKY\_POL\_EXTENDED\_]}

\subsection{\xlabel{automatic_registration}Automatic
Registration\label{automatic_registration}}

This makes an inventory of the sources above a threshold in each
frame.  It then performs a \xref{pattern
recognition}{sun139}{mosaicing} to identify common features in
jittered frames.  If the fraction of common objects is under 40\% or
the total is fewer than three, the registration fails, and so the
script resorts to reading the telescope offsets stored in the
\FITSref\ headers, or matching a central bright object in certain
recipes.  Using telescope offsets can lead to trailed sources, as
occurred with the \xref{{\footnotesize IRCAMDR} package}{sun41}{}. The
improved registration leads to the detection of fainter sources and
more-accurate measurement thereof.

To make use of the best information, registration using more than one
of the above methods is permitted.

There is also a new but not extensively tested option in which
matching is performed only within overlapping regions as specified
from the approximate world co-ordinate system, and a single match
within 12 pixels is allowed to define the offsets between frames. This
modification should allow more registrations using sources than from
telescope offsets, which merely assist in the process.  Since the
robustness is unknown at present, this option is currently disabled by
default.  The easiest way to switch it on, is to change the 
the default value of the SKYREG argument primitive \_GENERATE\_OFFSETS\_
to 1.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{moving_targets}Moving Targets\label{moving_targets}}

For a moving target, it is possible to permit the telescope to track
at sidereal rate, and adjust the telescope offsets for the motion of a
slowly moving target, {\em i.e.}\ one that stays within the field
within an observation group.  Registration uses the revised
offsets and in the mosaic the stars trail while the object does not,
and so can be seen and measured more easily.

At present the ephemeris is via a pre-prepared text file, given by
environment variable \goodbreak {\tt ORAC\_EPHEMERIS}, if defined, otherwise
{\tt\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT/target\_ephemeris.dat}.  See one of the
moving-target recipes, say
\htmlref{MOVING\_JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT}{MOVING\_JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT}, for
more details.  Once the ephemeris is available as a web service, the
file could become merely a backup; this would automate the process and
so the observer would not have to prepare the file at altitude just
before the epoch of observation.
\newline {\em[\_ADJUST\_OFFSETS\_TO\_MOVING\_TARGET\_]}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{polarimetry_registration}Polarimetry
Registration\label{polarimetry_registration}}

Registration involves both the dithered observations as normal, but also
the e- and o-beams at each waveplate angle must align.  To aid the
latter an approximate pixel displacement between the e- and o-beams
from empirical data is set for each filter, as the displacement is
wavelength dependent.  Even an approximate offset almost invariably
leads to successful registration using the central source.

\subsection{\xlabel{mosaicking}Mosaicking\label{mosaicking}}

This is fully automated.  No longer do you have to measure
painstakingly centroids and manually tile to form mosaics from the
jittered frames.  The jitter offsets are sufficiently small to permit
shift of Cartesian co-ordinates to register.  The offsets are derived
from the automatic registration.  No correction for the detector
orientation is applied, since it degrades the quality of the data,
despite the small rotation

system}{http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/documents.html#WCS}. In the meantime
should you need the rotation angle, pipe the output of KAPPA's
\xref{{\bf fitslist}}{sun95}{FITSLIST} function into grep.

\begin{verbatim}
      % fitslist <your_frame> | grep CROTA2
\end{verbatim}

The flat-fielded frame can either be resampled to give sub-pixel
registration, or to the nearest pixel.  The latter is much faster and
is adequate for most uses of \UFTI, \UIST, thermal \IRCAM, and \Michelle.  It also
has the advantage of not smoothing the data and introducing covariance
into the data errors.  For older
undersampled IRCAM3 data
\begin{latexonly}
(0.$\uarcs$286
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
(0.286 arcseconds
\end{htmlonly}
per pixel) and for INGRID 
\begin{latexonly}
(0.$\uarcs$235
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
(0.235 arcseconds
\end{htmlonly}
resampling has some merit.

The mosaicking uses the \xref{\CCDPACK\ algorithm}{sun139}{mosaicing}
of its \xref{{\bf makemos}}{sun139}{MAKEMOS} command.  Only zero-point
shifts of intensity are applied to the resampled frames to create the
mosaic.  For most cases the comparison is of the sky levels as sky
pixels dominate.  This comparison is repeated for all pairs.  {\bf
makemos} then finds the most mutually consistent set of additive
corrections, weighting appropriately, to make the smoothest mosaic
given the data. The first frame, which for the \UFTI\ execs is the
central (offset 0,0) frame, has no additive correction applied.  The
mosaic generation adjusts the zero-point of the jittered frames.
Another way of looking at it is that mosaicking attempts to remove the
sky variations.  The additive corrections are normally quite small,
like a few tenths of a count to a few counts.  However, over longer
integrations or in the thermal regime they can amount to a few score.
A mosaic pixel value is the mean of all the adjusted contributing
pixel values at that location.  It is possible to select other
statistics for the contributing pixels, such as the median, through
the METHOD argument of the \_MAKE\_MOSAIC\_ family of primitives.

There is no normalisation to counts per second in the mosaic. The
mosaic's signal corresponds to that of the first frame, thus the
exposure time of the mosaic is that of one individual frame.  The
recipes assume that you have used their corresponding `execs'
or`sequences', and hence have not changed the exposure time during a
jitter.  The exposure time (header EXP\_TIME [UFTI/UIST/Michelle],
EXPOSED [IRIS2], EXPTIME [INGRID/ISAAC] or DEXPTIME [IRCAM]) is
propagated from the first frame to the mosaic.  Where multiple frames
combined to create a mosaic pixel the signal-to-noise ratio
corresponds to the combined integration time.  The integration time
(keyword INT\_TIME [UFTI], TOTALEXP [IRIS2], or EXPOSED [IRCAM]) is
the number of coadds times the exposure time per coadd.

Depending on the recipe, the mosaic may be trimmed to the dimensions
of a raw frame.  Mosaicking removes virtually all the bad pixels for
standard stars where the jitter offsets are small.

A mosaic forms for each cycle of the recipe, {\em{e.g.}}\ all four frames in a
\htmlref{QUADRANT\_JITTER}{QUADRANT\_JITTER}.  For multiple cycles, an
integrated `grand' mosaic forms of improving signal-to-noise.  To
avoid the build up of bad pixels from cosmic rays, bad pixels are
interpolated before the addition.  This may result in some strange
stripes in the top-left corner of UFTI frames where no interpolation
can occur.  Those pixels are bad in all frames and should be ignored.
The exposure-time header for the integrating mosaic is the sum of the
exposure times of the contributing mosaics.  Again the signal is not
divided by the exposure time.  \newline {\em[\_MAKE\_MOSAIC\_ and invoked within

Resampling\label{polarimetry_resampling}}

To permit the calculation of the Stokes parameters, polarimetry recipes 
resamples each frame using non-integer Cartesian offsets, or merely
finds the offsets between frames to the nearest pixel and shifts the
origin.  The mosaic extends to include all pixels in contributing
the frames, however, in practice there should be at most one pixel
variation in dimensions.

These are outlined in the ``Output Data'' section of the polarimetry

offset of 6.3 degrees clockwise is applied to the rotation angle for

\subsection{\xlabel{near_infra-red_aperture_photometry}Near Infra-red Aperture
Photometry\label{near_infra-red_aperture_photometry}}

The recipes with an \_APHOT suffix (except
\htmlref{NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT}{NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT}) perform aperture
photometry on the mosaic and the contributing flat-fielded frames.
The method assumes that the target, usually a standard star, is
approximately centrally located after allowing for the jitter offsets.
If you have data where the star lies outside the aperture, it is
possible to apply an offset.  See the RAOFF and DECOFF arguments of
primitive \_FIXED\_APERTURE\_PHOTOMETRY\_ in \_APHOT\_MAG\_ to adjust
the aperture's position.  The thermal
\htmlref{chopped}{chopping} data have sources displaced from the centre, but
the reductions allow for the symmetric offsets about the mean jitter
position.

Residual bad pixels (usually in the individual flat-fielded frames
are removed by median filtering.  This does leave a bias in the wings
of stars, but certainly the underestimate is far less than ignoring
the bad pixels.

The photometry is through a circular aperture located at the centroid
of the source, with the sky measured from a concentric annulus outside
the aperture.  The default aperture size is 5 arcseconds.  The annulus
diameters are 6.5 to 10 arcseconds (all instruments but UFTI), and 6.5
to 12.5 arcseconds (\UFTI).  The default estimator of the sky flux is
the mode calculated from $3*{\rm median}-2*{\rm mean}$ and Chauvenet's
rejection criterion.  The photometry accounts for fractional pixels at
the aperture edge but without allowance for the local gradient.

The magnitudes are given by the expression $-2.5 $\lsk$
$log10(abs(counts) per second exposure time).  Therefore negative
sources can be measured too, as presented by the thermal photometry
recipe \htmlref{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK\_APHOT}{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK\_APHOT}.
The photometry also yields an internal error determined from
the sky variance.

A case- and space-insensitive comparison of the object name with the
entries in a table provides a catalogue magnitude for a standard star
in $I$, $Z$, $J$, $H$, or $K$ for all instruments, and in $L$ or $M$
for \IRCAM\ and \ISAAC.  Also a mean extinction is applied for the mean
of the start and end airmasses.  Thus the primitive calculates an
approximate zero point.  Note that ISAAC standard stars include additional
objects to the \htmladdnormallink{UKIRT faint-standard
list}{http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/UKIRT/astronomy/calib/faint_stds.html};
for these the magnitude and
derived zero point will not be determined automatically.  For accurate
photometry the actual extinction coefficients should be determined.
As the output from the photometry is a \xref{small text
list}{sun190}{STLREF}, you can use
\xref{{\bf catphotomfit} command}{sun190}{PHOTCAL} of the \CURSA\ package
to achieve this.  The units and meanings of the columns are documented
within each small text list.

The seeing is estimated for each frame and the mosaic by fitting a
two-dimensional Gaussian to the star, although in good seeing the
UKIRT images are more centrally concentrated than a Gaussian.  The
full-width-half-maximum so derived is also tabulated in the small text
list.

\subsection{\xlabel{mid-infra-red_aperture_photometry}Mid-infra-red Aperture
Photometry\label{mid-infra-red_aperture_photometry}}

This is similar to \htmlref{near infra-red aperture
photometry}{near_infra-red_aperture_photometry}.  The main difference
is the source measured.  Rather than measuring each positive and
negative image, \htmlref{NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT}{NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT}
integrates the average flux of the two positive and two negative
images in the chopped and nodded mosaic.  The four images are first
registered using their centroids; extracted with a symmetric
neighbouring background, but without any duplication of pixels from
the original mosaic; and finally combined, averaging to preserve the
flux per unit time.  The exposure-time header, therefore, remains that
of the mosaic.

The aperture size is 5 arcseconds.  The background is determined
from an annulus with an inner diameter of 7.5 arcseconds and an
outer diameter of 15 arcseconds enclosing the source.  The Michelle chip
characteristics and the UKIRT chop throw limit the area of this
combined-image mosaic---normally a 15-arcsecond square---leaving
comparatively little background.  Recommended apertures and background
regions may change in the light of experience with Michelle.  Already
in below-average seeing, it's evident that a 6-arcsecond circle will
leave some signal in the background.

The object name is compared with a 28-member \htmladdnormallink{catalogue of 10- and
20-micron standards}{http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/UKIRT/astronomy/calib/IRTF_NQ.html},
a handful of which are known optical semi-regular variable stars.  In
addition to deriving magnitudes, the recipe calculates an approximate
flux in Janskys.  It is approximate because being an {\em absolute}
measurement, it does require a magnitude zero point to be applied to
the {\em relative} instrumental magnitude. At the time of writing this
zero-point is only roughly known, so the default fluxes should be
taken with a pinch of salt.  The flux is not yet written to the
results file.  If you have determined the zero point from standards,
you can rerun the pipeline for your target observations with that zero
point assigned to argument ZP of primitive \_NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT\_MAG\_
invoked within recipe NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT.  See

the signal-to-noise of Mid-infra-red
Data\label{improving_the_signal-to-noise_of_mid-infra-red_data}}

The Michelle electronics can leave an uneven mosaic with vertical
banding from bias variations and horizontal ripple patterns from
electronic pickup.  Therefore, Michelle NOD\_CHOP recipes subtract the
median along each column of the mosaic, then subtracts the median
along each row.  This cleaning aids the visibility of faint sources.

In the mid-infra-red, the sky signal is vastly greater than the signal
than even the brightest sources.  While the nodding removes the bulk
of the sky signal, the sky noise remains, still swamping the signal
from a faint source.  Integrating over many nod-chop cycles is needed,
and the real-time display of \ORACDR\ does permit interactive review
of the signal-to-noise in \GAIA\ so observers can curtail data collection
when the required contrast is achieved.  Averaging the two positive and
two negative signals and neighbourhoods into a combined signal ({\em{cf.}}\
\begin{latexonly}

\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}

\end{htmlonly}
only helps by a factor of two.
Recipe \htmlref{NOD\_CHOP\_FAINT}{NOD\_CHOP\_FAINT} smooths the combined quadrant with a
4-by-4-pixel neighbourhood running average filter to help reveal faint
sources. 

While smoothing reveals the sources, it is not sufficient. There is
also a confusion issue.  The chopping can bring positive and negative
sources actually located beyond the final quadrant to within it.
There is an option of the \_COMBINE\_CHOPPED\_SOURCE\_ primitive,
called by recipe NOD\_CHOP recipes, which attempts to clarify which
sources are actually present in the quadrant by forming a quality map.
Each quality pixel is the sum of the four corresponding pixel values
divided by their absolute values, after changing sign for the
quadrants containing the negative images.  In the map +4 indicates
that a pixel had positive contributions from the positive quadrants
and negative signals from the negative quadrants.  A quality of +4
strongly implies that the signal is really at the sky location
indicated.  Thus it helps to discriminate from sources which have been
chopped into view, for which there are no positive or negative
counterparts (values +/$-$2) or noise (0, +/$-$2).  Around the sky (which
should be near zero) noise randomises the quality measurement,
therefore smoothing should be used in conjunction with the quality
map.

To create a quality map at each cycle, you should set argument QMAP=1

Each recipe has a tidy procedure, which removes unnecessary

removed in individual primitives, but some registration-related files
do persist until the tidy script cleans up.  If you need to retain the

\section{\xlabel{customising_recipes}Customising

If you wish to write your own data-reduction recipes, you should
consult the {\em \ORACDR\ Programmer's Guide\/}
(\xref{SUN/233}{sun233}{}).  However, for most purposes, observers
wishing to modify existing scripts can get by without this document.

A easier-to-use tailoring system to control parameters and primitive
arguments from the command line and `personal' style files is under
consideration.

\subsection{\xlabel{search_paths}Search paths\label{search_paths}}

\ORACDR\ allows you to create your own recipes and primitives, or
modify those provided as part of the package.  In either case you must
tell \ORACDR\ where your recipes and/or primitives are stored.  This
is achieved through two environment variables.  {\tt\$ORAC\_RECIPE\_DIR}
should equate to the directory containing your recipes.
{\tt \$ORAC\_PRIMITIVE\_DIR} specifies the directory containing your
primitives.  Here's an example.

\begin{verbatim}
      % setenv ORAC_RECIPE_DIR /home/user/drmoan/recipes
      % setenv ORAC_PRIMITIVE_DIR /home/user/drmoan/primitives
\end{verbatim}

Once these environment variables are defined, \ORACDR\ first looks in
{\tt \$ORAC\_RECIPE\_DIR} or {\tt \$ORAC\_PRIMITIVE\_DIR} to find a recipe or
primitive respectively.  If the script is absent, \ORACDR\ looks in
the standard {\tt \$ORAC\_DIR} directories.

\subsection{\xlabel{anatomy_of_an_imaging_recipe}Anatomy of an imaging recipe}

There are documentation modules---a Starlink style between \verb/#+/ and
\verb/#-/ delimiters at the head, and a Perl POD (Plain Old
Documentation) at the foot.  Between these is the code.  This consists
of calls to primitives, sometimes with arguments.  Primitives have
uppercase names preceded and terminated by underscores, such as
\_DIVIDE\_BY\_FLAT\_.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{hello_primitives}Hello
primitives\label{hello_primitives}}

The first of these primitives is \_IMAGING\_HELLO\_.
It contains instrument-specific code and initialisation.  It is
best left alone.  See 
\begin{htmlonly}
\htmlref{preliminaries}{preliminaries}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
Section~\ref{preliminaries}
\end{latexonly}
for a description of what this primitive does for each instrument.

Second there is a recipe-specific primitive such as
\_JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT\_HELLO\_.  This sets up \CCDPACK,
\htmlref{sets directives}{steering_primitive} when to perform certain
operations, optionally \htmlref{create variances}{data_variance},
removes any bias, and \htmlref{edits the FITS headers}{fits_headers}.

Two things you might wish to change in the recipe {\tt\_HELLO} script are
listed below.

\begin{itemize}

\item Change the extent of the images.  If there is an instrumental defect
in some peripheral rows you might not want to use the full bounds
as given by headers RDOUT\_X1 ($x$ lower bound), RDOUT\_X2
($x$ upper bound), and RDOUT\_Y1 and RDOUT\_Y2 for $y$.  Suppose you
wanted to trim off the top three rows you could change the line.

\begin{verbatim}
    my $y2 = $Frm->hdr( "RDOUT_Y2" );
\end{verbatim}
to
\begin{verbatim}
    my $y2 = $Frm->hdr( "RDOUT_Y2" ) - 3;
\end{verbatim}

\item 
\xlabel{switch_on_data_variance}\label{switch_on_data_variance}
Switch on error propagation.  To save time at the telescope, the
pipeline does not keep track of the errors per pixel (except for the
polarimetry recipes with names starting ``POL'' and the NOD\_CHOP
series).  If you wish to know realistic errors for your data, in the
recipe switch on the USEVAR argument for the recipe's {\tt\_HELLO}
primitive.  Here is an example for the
\htmlref{BRIGHT\_POINT\_SOURCE}{BRIGHT\_POINT\_SOURCE} recipe.

\begin{verbatim}
    _BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE_HELLO_ USEVAR=1
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\xlabel{steering_primitive}Steering
primitive\label{steering_primitive}}

Within a recipe's {\tt\_HELLO} primitive, a `steering' primitive is invoked.
These are best left well alone.  They control when the various
operations are performed.  See
\begin{htmlonly}
\htmlref{steering headers}{steering_headers}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
Appendix~\ref{steering_headers}
\end{latexonly}
for more details.  What you can safely adjust are the
configurable steering parameters listed in the recipe documentation.
In the main these parameters set the number of frames processed in a
cycle through the recipe.  The parameters are passed by argument
through the recipe's {\tt\_HELLO} script to the steering primitive.

Suppose that for some reason an observation of a nine-point jitter
self flat was aborted after seven positions.  If you try the recipe
stored in the headers some processing will occur, but it will not
include mosaic creation.  The final steps inclusing mosaic creation
occur once all nine frames are dark subtracted.  Now there are no
seven-point recipes to substitute on the command line.  You could make
your own seven-point recipe to reduce those data.  First make a new
recipe by copying the standard one.

\begin{verbatim}
    % cd $ORAC_RECIPE_DIR
    % cp $ORAC_DIR/recipes/imaging/JITTER_SELF_FLAT ./JITTER7_SELF_FLAT
\end{verbatim}
Next edit JITTER7\_SELF\_FLAT and alter the line

\begin{verbatim}
      _JITTER_SELF_FLAT_HELLO_
\end{verbatim}
to become

\begin{verbatim}
      _JITTER_SELF_FLAT_HELLO_ NUMBER=7
\end{verbatim}
The recipe will then generate the self flat, flat field and make the
mosaic once the seventh frame is dark-subtracted.

Recipes are stored in {\tt\$ORAC\_DIR/recipes/imaging}; and for a few
instrument-specific recipes in {\tt\$ORAC\_DIR/recipes/$<$instrument$>$},
where {\tt$<$instrument$>$} is {\tt IRCAM}, {\tt MICHELLE}, {\tt
UFTI}. {\tt IRIS2}, {\tt ISAAC}, or {\tt INGRID}.  See 
\begin{htmlonly}
\htmlref{the notes}{instrument_recipe_notes}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
Appendix~\ref{instrument_recipe_notes}
\end{latexonly}
for some details.

\subsubsection{\xlabel{recipe_primitives}Recipe primitives\label{recipe_primitives}}

After the steering primitive we come to the recipe-specific scripts
that actually perform the recipe.  The most likely and easiest things
you would change are to add arguments or modify argument values of the
primitives in the recipes.  For instance, you might wish to change the
aperture diameter for the aperture photometry.  To alter to a
4-arcsecond aperture, change the APERTURE argument's value of the
\_APHOT\_MAG\_ primitive like below.

\begin{verbatim}
      _APHOT_MAG_ APERTURE=4
\end{verbatim}

To obtain details of a primitive's arguments, use the {\bf oracman}
or {\bf perldoc} command.  Thus

\begin{verbatim}
      % oracman _MAKE_MOSAIC_
\end{verbatim}
will display the documentation for primitive \_MAKE\_MOSAIC\_.  Space
does not permit inclusion of the documentation of the many primitives
in this manual.  Most of primitives' source code is stored in {\tt
\$ORAC\_DIR/primitives/imaging}; the instrument-specific ones are
situated within {\tt \$ORAC\_DIR/primitives/$<$instrument$>$}, where
{\tt$<$instrument$>$} is {\tt UFTI}, {\tt UIST}, {\tt MICHELLE}, {\tt
IRCAM}, {\tt IRIS2}, {\tt ISAAC}, or {\tt INGRID}; and there are a few
general scripts in \goodbreak{\tt \$ORAC\_DIR/primitives/general}.

While the simplest primitives just invoke a Starlink task, and updates
just that and are amenable to customisation, some are quite complex
especially for the registration.  They may invoke other primitives,
manipulate parameters and small data files so that the various tasks
connect to cope with a variety of circumstances.  The most likely
change you will want to make is to change the parameter values of a
Starlink task.  Armed with the reference documentation for the
application, say with a {\tt findme $<$application$>$}, it is easy
to change values or append further parameters.  

Here is an example.  Let us suppose you wanted to combine frames to
make a self flat, not with the median, since you have heard that a mean
trimmed of the most-extreme tenth of the values gives better results.
First copy \_MAKE\_FLAT\_FROM\_GROUP\_ to your primitives directory.

\begin{verbatim}
      % cp $ORAC_DIR/primitives/imaging/_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_ $ORAC_PRIMITIVE_DIR
\end{verbatim}
Using an editor, find the first line in your copy of
\_MAKE\_FLAT\_FROM\_GROUP\_ commencing {\tt \$hidden}.  It should be
as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
      $hidden = "method=median sigmas=2.0 reset accept"; 
\end{verbatim}
Change this to

\begin{verbatim}
      $hidden = "method=trimmed alpha=0.1 sigmas=2.0 reset accept"; 
\end{verbatim}
to effect the change of statistic.  There is in fact a second line
assigning variable {\tt \$hidden} depending on argument CLEAN, and you
should make the same alteration there too.

If there is demand, additional arguments could be provided for
primitives, to simplify control.  Please contact the author if you
have suggestions for arguments and new recipes, or need help
customising your \ORACDR\ scripts.

\subsection{\xlabel{index_files}Index files\label{index_files}}

Once the pipeline has run for a bit you will find text files in {\tt
\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT} called {\tt index.flat}, {\tt index.dark} amongst
others.  These list the calibration frames.  \ORACDR\ uses these to
find the most-recent, appropriate calibration.  For example, a flat
requires that the filter of the flat matches that of the frame being
flat fielded, and a dark must have the same exposure time as the
target frame; and both must have been taken in the same instrument
mode.

Here is an example of a flat index.

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
The first line contains the column headings.  ORACTIME is the UT in
decimal hours, and WPLANGLE is the polarisation waveplate angle.

In general you should not manipulate these files.  Mis-editing can
lead to the calibration system breaking down.  If you must edit this
file, say to exclude a poor dark or an uneven flat, restrict yourself
deleting the line corresponding to that calibration file.  It's safer
to remove the calibration file and recreate a new one with the
calibration frames you want by running the pipeline.

If you want to nominate specific calibration frames, overriding those
selected from the calibration indices, there is a {\tt -calib} option
for the {\bf oracdr} command to do this.  See
\begin{latexonly}

\end{latexonly}

for examples.

\section{\xlabel{correcting_headers}Correcting headers}

There are reasons why you may need to edit some of the FITS headers
used by \ORACDR.

\begin{itemize}
\item  At the summit of Mauna Kea, it's easy to make mistakes.  One of
the common ones is to make an error in the `exec' or `sequence'.  This
can cause, for example, frames to be in the wrong observation groups
or be assigned the wrong data-reduction recipe.  While the ORAC
Observation Tool has reduced the frequency of such errors, they will
not be eliminated.

\item You may have made some trial observations before taking making
a longer integration through several cycles of a recipe.  Now you wish
to combine all the observations of a target to obtain the best
signal-to-noise.  
\end{itemize}

The main headers to change are
\begin{description}
\item [{\tt RECIPE}]---the data-reduction recipe;
\item [{\tt NOFFSETS}]---the number of offsets;
\item [{\tt OBSNUM}]---the number of the frame, starting from 1 on
each night;
\item [{\tt GRPNUM}]---the group number, and should be
given by the frame number (OBSNUM) of its first member; and
\item [{\tt GRPMEM}]---whether or not the frame participates in group
processing.
\end{description}

For IRCAM, Michelle, UIST, UFTI, and converted ISAC files, it is
possible to edit the NDF's
\xref{FITS extension}{sun95}{se_fitsairlock} using \KAPPA's
\xref{{\bf fitsmod}}{sun95}{FITSMOD} command.  The command is a bit
long and the author regrets not defining a {\bf fitsupdate} synonym.
The following changes the GRPNUM keyword to have value 36 in the raw
NDF frame f19991108\_00042.

\begin{verbatim}
      % fitsmod f19991108_00042 grpnum u 36 \$C !
\end{verbatim}

It's possible to edit many files using a \xref{C-shell}{sc4}{} or Perl
script to edit a series of files very quickly.  If you do, it's better
to specify the values by keyword instead of position, like this

\begin{verbatim}
      % fitsmod ndf=f19991108_00042 edit=update keyword=grpnum value=36 \
                position=! comment=\$C
\end{verbatim}
because it is better insulated against change to {\bf fitsmod}.

If the file being edited is a multi-NDF container file, you can avoid
disconcerting, but harmless error messages if you change the {\bf
fitsmod} command to specify the HEADER NDF.  Here is an example for
Michelle data, which changes the number of offsets.

\begin{verbatim}
      % fitsmod m20011107_00079_raw.header noffsets u 5 \$C !
\end{verbatim}

For IRIS2, INGRID, or old UFTI data, you can edit the raw FITS files.
{\tt\$ORAC\_DIR/bin/fitsmod.pl} is a documented example Perl script to
edit FITS headers.  The intention is for you to make a copy and edit
to suit your particular header-editing requirements.

UKIRT data obtained before 2000 August\label{
processing_ukirt_data_obtained_before_2000_august}}%
\index{processing_data_obtained_before_2000_august}

Before the introduction of
\htmladdnormallink{ORAC}{http://www.stsci.edu/stsci/meetings/adassVII/bridgera.html}
on 2000 August 1, UFTI raw data were in \FITSref\ format, IRCAM data had a
different naming convention, and there were different default paths for
{\tt\$ORAC\_DATA\_IN} and {\tt\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT}.  IRCAM's NDFs were
copied to {\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT}, and UFTI's raw FITS files were
converted to NDFs in that directory.

To process data from this era, follow the instructions 
\begin{htmlonly}
\htmlref{for using the pipeline}{setting_up_orac-dr}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
of Section~\ref{setting_up_orac-dr}
\end{latexonly}
except you should invoke 
\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr_<instrument>_old <date>
\end{verbatim}
instead of
\begin{verbatim}
      % oracdr_<instrument> <date>
\end{verbatim}
to set up the necessary environment variables.  The rest is the same.

You can use modern jitter-generic recipes too, provided they know how
many frames to process.  The easiest way to do that is make your own
copy of the recipe and set the number frames as an argument to the
steering primitive.  See
\begin{htmlonly}
\htmlref{here}{steering_primitive}
\end{htmlonly}
\begin{latexonly}
Section~\ref{steering_primitive}
\end{latexonly}
for details.

The standard raw and reduced directories prior to 2000 August were
\linebreak {\tt $<$instrument$>$\_data/YYYYMMDD/raw/}, and {\tt
$<$instrument$>$\_data/YYYYMMDD/reduced/} respectively, where
{\tt$<$instrument$>$} was either {\tt ufti} or {\tt ircam}.

Details of the former naming convention for IRCAM frames is given under
the ``Output Data'' headings in the \htmlref{reference section}{recipes}.

\section{\xlabel{file_suffices}File suffices}\label{file_suffices}%
\index{file_suffices}

Files generated during \ORACDR\ imaging data reduction have suffices
denoting the processing step that created them.  This appendix
contains a list with short descriptions of what they mean.  Most will
be removed once a recipe has finished using them.  So you will
probably only see these files if you list the contents of directory
{\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT} while the pipeline is running, or you interrupt the
pipeline with {\tt CTRL/C}, or something has gone wrong with the the
recipe and pipeline has aborted, or you have commented out the `\_TIDY'
primitive from the recipe, or you have set the {\tt ORAC\_KEEP} environment
variable to 1.

\subsection{\xlabel{classified_recipes}Classified Recipes}

In hindsight you may decide that there was a better recipe for your
data than stored in the RECIPE header.  Also you may have used a
faster variant of a recipe at the telescope, but now want the full
reduction.  Here is a classified list so that you can select an
alternative.  Magnitudes and dimensions apply to UFTI, except for the
NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK recipes, whose magnitude ranges are for
IRCAM; and the $\lsk$NOD\_CHOP$\lsk$ recipes which are applicable to
\Michelle.  For \IRCAM, dimensions are 22\% smaller; for \IRIS dimensions
are 6.8$\times$ larger.  The magnitude ranges are courtesy of Sandy Leggett.

\subsection{Reference documentation}

The following recipes apply to both UFTI and IRCAM unless otherwise
noted.  Where there are processing differences for the two instruments,
they are noted in the reference specification.  Also there is an
ARRAY\_TESTS recipe for each instrument, of which only UFTI's is
presented below for technical reasons.

In the {\bf Configurable Steering Parameters} sections the defaults
appear at the end of the parameter's description between {\tt [~]}.

The non-generic recipes of the original release are not documented
here, but are still available for reducing pre-ORAC (2000 August)
data.  They are listed in the {\bf Deprecated variants} section of
their generic counterpart.  Each behaves as the generic counterpart,
except the number of jitter points is fixed.  Thus the
JITTER9\_SELF\_FLAT reduces a nine-point jitter.

   \sstdescription{
      This script reduces a "bright standard" photometry observation with
      UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising a
      series of jittered object frames and a dark frame, and a predetermined
      flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic automatically.

      This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
      subtraction, flat-field division, registration using telescope offsets,
      and resampling.  See the \htmlref{``Notes''}{bpst_notes} for details.

      As the name implies, it is intended for bright point sources,
      such as standard stars, where automatic registration fails.

   Reduction of alternating sky-target jitters using interpolated sky

      This recipe reduces a moderately extended source using near-infrared 
      imaging data.  The data comprise alternating blank-sky and target frames

         \sstitem
         The flat field is derived from the sky frames as follows.  The
         mode (sigma-clipped mean) is used to offset each sky frame's mode
         to that of the first sky frame.  The corrected sky frames are
         combined pixel by pixel using a median of the values in each
         frame.  The resultant frame is normalised by its median to form
         the flat field.  This frame median is subtracted from the source
         frames after they have been flat-fielded.  A flat field is created
         from all the jittered sky frames, and applied to all the target
         frames.

         \sstitem
         For ISAAC, residual bias variations along the columns are
         largely removed from each flat-fielded frame.  The recipe first
         masks the sources, then collapses the frame along its rows to form
         a profile, whose clipped mean is subtracted.  The resultant profile
         reflects the bias variations.  The recipe subtracts this profile
         from each column of the flat-fielded frame.

         \sstitem
         The sky subtraction comes from linear interpolation of the sky
         modal values of the two flat-fielded sky frames which immediately
         bracket the target frame.

         \sstitem

         Registration is performed using common point sources in the
         overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
         objects, it then tries the crosshead offsets.  If these are null,
         the script resorts to the telescope offsets.

         \sstitem
         The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
         bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
         Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

         The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
         to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.

         At the end of each cycle of sky and object frames the full
         mosaic of target frames is created and displayed.  The mosaic has
         its bad pixels filled by interpolation.  On the second and
         subsequent cycles the full mosaic is added into a master mosaic of
         improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and

      This recipe reduces an extended source using near-infrared imaging data.
      The data comprise alternating blank-sky and target frames commencing

         Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
         pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
         deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range $-$100 to 1.
         The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
         in the mode used.

         \sstitem
         The flat field is derived from the sky frames as follows.  The
         mode (sigma-clipped mean) is used to offset each sky frame's mode
         to that of the first sky frame.  The corrected sky frames are
         combined pixel by pixel using a median of the values in each
         frame.  The resultant frame is normalised by its median to form
         the flat field.  This frame median is subtracted from the source
         frames after they have been flat-fielded.  A flat field is created
         for each row of the grid of target frames, and applied only to
         that row of target frames.

         \sstitem
         The sky subtraction comes from linear interpolation of the sky
         modal values of the two flat-fielded sky frames which immediately
         bracket the target frame.

         \sstitem
         Registration is performed using common point sources in the
         overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
         objects, it then tries the crosshead offsets.  If these are null,
         the script resorts to the telescope offsets.

         \sstitem
         The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
         bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
         Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

         \sstitem
         The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
         to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
         The noise will be greater in the mosaic's peripheral areas, having

         At the end of each cycle of 19 frames the full mosaic of nine target
         frames is created and displayed instead.  On the second and
         subsequent cycles the full mosaic is added into a master mosaic of
         improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
         stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end

   Basic extended-source standard reduction using interpolated sky

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This recipe reduces an extended source using near-infrared imaging data.
      The data comprise alternating blank-sky and target frames commencing
      and ending with a blank sky.  The target frames are arranged in an
      overlapping (30--50\%) grid of 5$\times$5 frames from which the recipe
      makes a sky-subtracted untrimmed mosaic automatically.

      The script performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
      subtraction, flat-field division, sky subtraction, registration
      using telescope offsets, and mosaicking.  The
      \htmlref{``Notes''}{e5x5b_notes} give more details.

      It is suitable for extended objects up to 3 arcminutes across
      with UFTI, 42 arcseconds with IRCAM, and 20 arcminutes with IRIS2.

         The flat field is derived from the sky frames as follows.  The
         mode (sigma-clipped mean) is used to offset each sky frame's mode
         to that of the first sky frame.  The corrected sky frames are
         combined pixel by pixel using a median of the values in each
         frame.  The resultant frame is normalised by its median to form
         the flat field.  This frame median is subtracted from the source
         frames after they have been flat-fielded.  A flat field is created
         for each row of the grid of target frames, and applied only to
         that row of target frames.

         \sstitem
         The sky subtraction comes from linear interpolation of the sky

      to make a continuum-subtracted and sky-subtracted, untrimmed mosaic

      This script reduces a Fabry-Perot observation with UFTI data.  It

   Reduces a spatially jittered 4-frame Fabry-Perot observation
}{
   \sstdescription{
      This script reduces a Fabry-Perot observation with UFTI data.  It
      takes an imaging observation comprising at least three sets of
      four object frames, each set being for a different telescope position.
      The recipe combines these with a dark frame and a separate flat, to
      make a continuum-subtracted, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

      Each sequence of four frames expected in each spatial position are
      tabulated below.

      \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{cll}
      Frame & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Position} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Wavelength} \\ \hline
        1 & On  source & On  line \\
        2 & On  source & Off line, positive offset \\
        3 & On  source & On  line \\
        4 & On  source & Off line, negative offset \\
      \end{tabular}
      \end{center}

      For each spatial set, the recipe performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel
      masking, dark subtraction, pairwise frame differencing, flat-field
      division, integer shifts of origin to register, and mosaicking.  The
      wavelength-shifted mosaic is given by

      \begin{center}
      \[ \frac{[(F1 - F2) - (F4 - F3)]}{\rm Flat field} \]
      \end{center}

      where $Fn$ is the bad-pixel masked and dark subtracted frame $n$.
      In practice, the flat field is applied to each differenced pair,
      such as ($F1 - F2$), when the pair becomes available, rather than
      waiting until all four frames have been observed.

      Finally the recipe registers all the wavelength mosaics spatially, and
      forms a untrimmed mosaic, combined using the median to reduce stellar
      artifacts.

   \sstdescription{
      This script reduces a ``standard jitter'' photometry observation
      with near-infrared imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation
      comprising jittered object frames and a dark frame to make a
      calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

      It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
      subtraction, flat-field creation, flat-field division, integer
      shifts of origin to register, and mosaicking.  See the
      \htmlref{``Notes''}{jsfb_notes} for further information.

      This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming
      data, and is intended for faint sources and for moderately

      using telescope offsets, and resampling.  See the

         the gain, divided by the number of multiple reads.  Otherwise, the

   Reduces a ``standard jitter'' photometry observation of a

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This script reduces a ``standard jitter'' photometry observation
      with UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an observation comprising
      jittered object frames of a moving target and a dark frame to make
      automatically a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic in the reference
      frame of the target.

      It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
      subtraction, flat-field creation and division, amd integer shifts
      of pixel origin to register to fixed sky co-ordinates.   See the
      \htmlref{``Notes''}{mjsfb_notes} for further information.

      The registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
      target using ephemeris data stored in file {\tt target\_ephem.dat}.
      See \htmlref{``Ephemeris-file Format''}{mjsfb_ephem_format} for details
      of this file's format.

      This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming data.
      It works well for faint moving sources and in moderately
      crowded fields.  It should not be used for frames where the
      telescope guided on the moving object.  In that case reduction
      should be performed by \htmlref{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT\_TELE}{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT\_TELE} which registers
      using the telescope offsets alone.

         noise, and once the bias is removed, Poisson noise is added.

         \sstitem
         A bias frame selected from the calibration system is removed from
         each beam in CHOP read mode.  If no bias frame is available
         in the CHOP mode, the recipe subtracts a null bias, so the errors
         will be overestimated in the CHOP read mode; the data array will
         be unaffected once the beams are differenced.  The 
         \htmlref{ARRAY\_TESTS}{ARRAY\_TESTS} recipe files a suitable
         short-exposure dark as a bias in the calibration system.

         \sstitem
         The integrations of the two beams are differenced, the first
         subtracted from the second in each pair.

         The telescope offsets of the first frame in each multiple-of-four
         frames define scan position.  The recipe creates a mosaic at each
         distinct pair of offsets.

         \sstitem
         Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
         transformed to pixels.

         \sstitem
         The resampling applies integer shifts of origin.   There is no
         rotation to align the Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

         \sstitem
         The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
         to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
         The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
         the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
         less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
         time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

         \sstitem
         For each cycle of object frames at each distinct scan position,
         the recipe creates a mosaic, which has its bad pixels filled and is
         then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise for
         that scan position.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in
         the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end
         UT headers are updated to match that of the last-observed frame
         contributing to the mosaic.

   Reduces an imaging polarimetry observation, where waveplate angle

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This script reduces a polarimetry observation with UKIRT imaging
      data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising object frames
      at the four waveplate angles 0, 45, 22.5, 67.5 degrees for each of
      of a series of jitter positions offset in Right Ascension; and a
      dark frame to make calibrated polarisation images and vectors
      automatically.  See \htmlref{``Output Data''}{paj_data} for a
      list of these images.

      It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction
      and flat-field division on all frames.  Next the sections of the frame
      representing the e- and o-beam target and sky regions are extracted,
      and the target frames sky-subtracted.  The resultant frames undergo
      registration and resampling to form a mosaic for each waveplate angle
      and beam.  Once all eight mosaics are formed they are registered and
      resampled, and then combined to form the various polarisation images.
      The polarisation data are binned and noisy data excluded from
      a final catalogue of vectors.  See the \htmlref{``Notes''}{paj_notes}
      for details.

      This recipe works well for point sources, and for extended sources
      whose sizes in Right Ascension and Declination are less than about
      35 and 15 arcseconds respectively for UFTI, or 9 and 4 arcseconds
      for IRCAM.  Objects which would appear in both the target and
      sky regions, {\em{i.e.}}\ Declination extents south of the centre
      larger than 35 arcseconds (UFTI) or 8 arcseconds (IRCAM), should

   \sstdescription{
      This script reduces a polarimetry observation with UKIRT imaging
      data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising alternating
      object and sky frames at the four waveplate angles 0, 45,
      22.5, 67.5 degrees in turn, then jittered to at least three
      positions; and a dark frame to make calibrated polarisation images
      and vectors automatically.  See \htmlref{``Output Data''}{pe_data}
      for a list of these images.

      It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction
      and flat-field division on all frames.  Next the sections of the
      target frame representing the e- and o-beam target regions are
      extracted and sky-subtracted.  The sky levels are determined from
      the two corresponding regions for each beam in the following sky
      frame.   The resultant frames undergo registration and resampling
      to form a mosaic for each waveplate angle and beam.  Once all eight
      mosaics are formed they are registered and resampled, and then

      data are binned and noisy data excluded from a final catalogue of

         The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity

         having received less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by
         its exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

         \sstitem
         For each cycle of twelve frames, the recipe creates mosaics
         for each beam and waveplate angle.  Each mosaic has its bad pixels
         filled and after the first cycle is then added into its own master
         mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also
         summed and stored in each master mosaic's corresponding

         The intensity image may be displayed with vectors overlaid.
         Steps are taken to reduce the number of noisy or insignificant
         pixels, as well as clutter.  First, the polarisation catalogue data
         are averaged in 3-by-3-pixel bins.  Second, a binned pixel is
         rejected if its polarisation is greater than 50\% or is not positive,
         or its polarisation signal to noise less than 3, or its polarisation
         error is greater 5\%.  The bin size and thresholds can readily be

         mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also
         summed and stored in each master mosaic's corresponding

         rejected if its polarisation is greater than 50\% or is not positive,

      This script reduces a chopped and nodded single-beam polarimetry
      observation, currently just for Michelle data.  The imaging
      observation should comprise a multiple-of-four object frames nodded
      and chopped, and integrated at the four waveplate angles 0, 45, 22.5,
      67.5 degrees in turn.  For each waveplate angle the recipe makes
      automatically a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic.  The recipe combines the
      multiple images of the source within each of these mosaics into new
      frames, and uses those four combined frames to calculate automatically
      calibrated polarisation images and vectors of the source.  See
      \htmlref{``Output Data''}{pnc_data} for a list of these images.

      It performs a null debiassing, creation and propagation of data
      variance, difference the integrations for each AB chop-beam pair,
      bad-pixel masking, difference adjacent nodded pairs, registers the
      frames, and forms a mosaic.  See the \htmlref{``Notes''}{pnc_notes}

         The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity

         For each waveplate angle, the combined source image is made by
         taking symmetrical areas about each source, such that no pixels
         are duplicated.  Thus the divisions occur at midpoints of the chop

   \sstdescription{
      This script reduces a ``quadrant jitter'' photometry observation
      with near-infrared imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
      one or more series of four object frames where the target is
      approximately centred in each quadrant; and a dark frame to make
      a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

      It performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark subtraction,
      flat-field creation and division, feature detection and matching
      between object frames, and resampling.   See the
      \htmlref{``Notes''}{qj_notes} for further information.

      This recipe is suitable for faint objects or objects within
      a comparatively bright core embedded in faint extended emission,
      {\em e.g.}\ a quasar; or extended objects less than 45 arcseconds across
      with UFTI, 10 arcseconds with IRCAM, and 2 arcminutes with IRIS2.  
      The object need not be
      isolated, as the recipe masks objects within the other quadrants,
      and hence does not introduce significant artifacts into the flat
      field.  For isolated objects use \htmlref{QUADRANT\_JITTER\_NO\_MASK}{QUADRANT\_JITTER\_NO\_MASK}; or where
      speed is critical, use \htmlref{QUADRANT\_JITTER\_BASIC}{QUADRANT\_JITTER\_BASIC} instead.

         This flat field is applied to the object frames.  Sources within
         the flat-fielded frames are detected, and masked in the

   Reduces a ``Quadrant Jitter'' observation, using just the basic

}{
   \sstdescription{
      This script reduces a ``quadrant jitter'' photometry observation
      with near-infrared imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
      one or more series of four object frames where the target is
      approximately centred in each quadrant; and a dark frame to make
      a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

      It performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark subtraction,
      flat-field creation and division, and registration using telescope
      offsets.  See the \htmlref{``Notes''}{qjb_notes} for further information.

      This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming
      data and many options which improve the final mosaic are omitted.
      This recipe is suitable for faint objects or objects within
      a comparatively bright core embedded in faint extended emission,
      {\em e.g.}\ a quasar; or extended objects less than 45 arcseconds across
      with UFTI, 10 arcseconds with IRCAM, and 2 arcminutes with IRIS2. 
      If the object is not
      isolated, there will be artifacts introduced into the flat field.
      These arise from the contribution of sources outside the quadrant
      containing the primary object.  This variant of
      \htmlref{QUADRANT\_JITTER}{QUADRANT\_JITTER} is
      best for isolated objects or where speed is critical.  Use
      QUADRANT\_JITTER itself if object masking is required instead.

\section{\xlabel{instrument_recipe_notes}Instrument Recipe
Notes\label{instrument_recipe_notes}}
\markboth{{\stardocname}~ --- Instrument Recipe Notes}
{{\stardocname}~--- Instrument Recipe Notes}

This appendix summarises the modifications of instrument-specific
variants of the recipes, and the restricted availability of certain
recipes by instrument.

\subsection{\INGRID}
By default the infrastructure uses information in the headers to
assign recipe names to \htmlref{REDUCE\_DARK}{REDUCE\_DARK} for a
dark, and \htmlref{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT}{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT} for
jittered target frames.  Otherwise it defaults to QUICK\_LOOK. Other
recipes supplied on the \xref{{\bf oracdr}}{sun230}{oracdr} command
line should work provided the observation pattern matches that
expected by the recipe.

\subsection{\IRCAM}
\htmlref{ARRAY\_TESTS}{ARRAY\_TESTS} uses eight frames and derives both
the STARE and ND\_STARE readout noises, which are both filed with the
calibration system.  The range of acceptable dark current is 0--10
electrons/sec compared with $-$1--$+$1 for \UFTI, and the nominal
ND\_STARE readout noise is 20--50 electrons compared with 8--30 electrons
for UFTI.  The STARE mode readout noise should be 30--70 electrons to
be nominal.  The log file goes to
{\tt\$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT/ircam3\_array\_tests.log}.

\subsection{\IRIS}
The four \htmlref{EXTENDED\_$n\times$$m$}{EXTENDED\_5x5} recipes cope
with missing offset information and a lower completeness (0.25 from
0.4) for automatic registration, thus a smaller fraction of detected
objects need match.

\htmlref{ARRAY\_TESTS}{ARRAY\_TESTS} logs to a different location
{\tt /inst2\_soft/iris2red/logs/array\_tests.log} at the AAT compared
with UFTI at UKIRT.  References to NDSTARE are not applicable, and so
are absent from the documentation. The observation mode is DRM.  The
upper limit on the readout noise is 20 electrons compared with 30
electrons for UFTI.

\subsection{\ISAAC}
The observation template and sequence names are converted into
matching recipes with a default of QUICK\_LOOK.  Available are:
\htmlref{CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER}{CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER},
\htmlref{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT}{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT},
\htmlref{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT\_APHOT}{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT\_APHOT},
\htmlref{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK}{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK},
\htmlref{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK-\_APHOT}{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK\_APHOT},
\htmlref{POL\_JITTER}{POL\_JITTER},
\htmlref{REDUCE\_DARK}{REDUCE\_DARK}, and
\htmlref{SKY\_FLAT\_MASKED}{SKY\_FLAT\_MASKED}.  Please note that at the time
of writing the polarimetry and thermal recipes have yet to be tested
with ISAAC data.  Other recipes supplied on the {\bf oracdr} command
line should work provided the observation pattern matches that
expected by the recipe.

The CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER recipe has no leading sky frame, so the recipe
subtracts the mode of the first sky frame from the first target frame,
rather than interpolating between the bracketting sky frames as occurs
in the standard version.

\subsection{\Michelle}
\htmlref{POL\_ANGLE\_NOD\_CHOP}{POL\_ANGLE\_NOD\_CHOP} and
\htmlref{POL\_NOD\_CHOP}{POL\_NOD\_CHOP} only apply to Michelle.

\htmlref{ARRAY\_TESTS}{ARRAY\_TESTS} calculates and files both an average
bias frame and the read noise in the calibration system.  There is no logging.

\subsection{\UFTI}
The \htmlref{FP}{FP} family of recipes only applies to UFTI.

\subsection{\UIST}
There is no ARRAY\_TESTS.  Instead there are 
\htmlref{DARK\_AND\_BPM}{DARK\_AND\_BPM} and
\htmlref{MEASURE\_READNOISE}{MEASURE\_READNOISE}.

There are JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT variants with a higher registration
completeness (0.5 from 0.4) giving purer registration but may rely on
the telescope offsets more often.

\section{\xlabel{internal_headers}Internal Headers\label{internal_headers}}
\markboth{{\stardocname}~ --- Internal Headers}
{{\stardocname}~--- Internal Headers}

\subsection{\xlabel{translated_headers}Translated Headers\label{translated_headers}}

The \ORACDR\ infrastructure translates instrument metadata stored in
FITS headers into internal headers.  An internal header offers a
common name, meaning, and units independent of the instrument, thereby
makes most recipe code portable between instruments, and increases
code reuse, a major theme of /ORACDR.  The internal headers are
accessed through the {\tt ORAC::Frame::uhdr()} and {\tt
ORAC::Group::uhdr()} methods (see \xref{Frame headers in SUN/233}{sun233}{}).

Below is a list of these translated internal headers and their
meanings and units.  Here are some notes pertaining to the table.

\begin{itemize}
\item In a primitive these header names have an {\tt ORAC\_} prefix,
for example, ORAC\_DEC\_SCALE.
\item The abbreviations for data type are B: boolean,
F: floating point, I: integer, and S: string.  Of the floating point
only the RA\_BASE and DEC\_BASE warrant double precision, but the
recipes impose no restriction.
\item Units are in brackets.
\item Some headers retain instrument-specific values, like ORAC\_SPEED
until a common set of instrument-independent names is compiled.

\subsection{\xlabel{steering_headers}Steering Headers\label{steering_headers}}

Headers which direct a recipe are called steering headers.  These can
include timing information, such as when a flat should be made;
qualifiers about the frame such as whether it is of a target or sky.
They use header information and membership index within a group.
The names of steering headers should be longer than eight characters
to avoid confusion with \FITSref\ keywords.

Most steering headers are per frame and are accessed by {\tt
ORAC::Frame::uhdr()} (see \xref{Frame headers in SUN/233}{sun233}{}).
Steering headers which must persist between frames, such as those
which define groups of related raw or processed frames like
differenced chopped pairs, must be stored in the group internal
headers, accessed by {\tt ORAC::Group::uhdr()}.

While programmers can create their own steering headers as needed, it
is silly to invent new names for ones which already exist and are
accessed by many primitives, which the programmers would then not be
able to use directly.

Here is a list of the common steering headers used in the imaging
recipes.  Not all headers are pertinent to all recipes.  The headers
used exclusively by specialist recipes, such as for Fabry-Perot
or nod-chop in a scan mode, are not listed below.  The
abbreviations for data type are B: boolean (1 for true, 0 for false),
I: integer, and S: string.  Note that some of the timing headers may
in fact switch on for the same frame.

\begin{tabular}{lcp{93mm}}
Name                & Type &  Meaning \\ \hline 
CYCLE\_NUMBER       & I & Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to 
                          complete a pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0. \\
DIFFERENCE\_PAIR    & B & Whether or not to subtract pairs.  It is normally true every 
                          second frame. \\
DO\_APHOT           & B & Whether or not perform aperture photometry.  Photometry is
                          performed once the mosaic is made. \\
EXTENDED\_ROW       & I & The row number of the frame for
                          \htmlref{EXTENDED\_$n\times$$m$}{EXTENDED_5x5} recipes. \\
FLAT\_DIVIDE        & B & Whether or not to apply a flat field. \\
JITTER\_FIRST       & B & This selects the ordering of polarimetry frames.  If true 
                          the jittering occurs at all positions before the waveplate is
                          turned.  If false, all waveplate angles are
                          observed at a given offset. \\
JITTER\_NUMBER      & I & The number of frames in the jitter. \\
MAKE\_FLAT          & B & Whether or not to make a flat-field. \\
MAKE\_GRAND\_MOSAIC & B & Whether or not register the frames and make the full mosaic
                          for EXTENDED\_$n\times$$m$ recipes. \\
MAKE\_MOSAIC        & B & Whether or not register the frames and make the mosaic. 
                          For EXTENDED\_$n\times$$m$ recipes it is the time to make a
                          row mosaic. \\
MASK\_OBJECTS       & B & Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
                          jittered frames in a cycle are available. \\
PAIR\_ORDER         & B & Pair subtraction order, true means take second from the first,
                          and false means take the first from the second. \\
POL\_CYCLE\_NUMBER  & B & Number of the polarimetry cycle, a cycle being a set of frames
                          to complete a pass through the recipe for all waveplate angles.
                          The first cycle is 0. \\
REFERENCE\_FRAME    & B & A true value specifies the reference frame for normalisation
                          of the masked frames.  It is true for the first frame
                          and false for all subsequent frames in the observation. \\
REGISTER\_IMAGES    & B & Whether or not to register and resample the polarimetric
                          e- and o-beam mosaics. \\
SUBTRACT\_SKY       & B & Whether or not it is time to subtract the sky.  Sky subtraction
                          normally occurs once all the frames in a cycle are available. \\
TARGET\_OR\_SKY     & S & This is {\tt "target"} for a target frame, and {\tt "sky"}
                          for a sky calibration frame. \\
TARGET\_NUMBER      & I & When TARGET\_OR\_SKY is {\tt "target"}, this counts the target
                          frames, starting from zero.  It is used for interpolation
                          between sky measurements. \\
USE\_VARIANCE       & B & Whether or not variance processing is to occur. \\
\medskip
WAVEPLATE\_FLAT     & B & Whether or not to make a flat for each polarimeter waveplate angle.
                          For non-polarimetric data, the value is immaterial.  For polarimetric
                          data, false means combine all waveplate angles to make the flat 
                          (there should be an equal number of each angle). \\ \hline

\markboth{{\stardocname}~ --- Release Notes---V4.0}
{{\stardocname}~--- Release Notes---V4.0}

The main changes are the addition of support for \UIST, \ISAAC, and
\INGRID instruments.

\subsection{New recipes}
\begin{description}
  \item [\htmlref{DARK\_AND\_BPM}{DARK\_AND\_BPM}]
    The design of the data-handling system means a traditional
    ARRAY\_TESTS is not possible for \UIST.  Thus there are two recipes
    to perform the equivalent steps for darks not in the same
    observation group.  This recipe uses a long-exposure DARK frame to 
    locate bad pixels, then creates and files a bad-pixel mask.  It
    then measures and reports the dark current from a long-exposure DARK
    frame.  If this recipe is run at \UKIRT, the dark current is stored in
    an engineering log file.
  \item [\htmlref{MAKE\_BPM}{MAKE\_BPM}]
    Creates and files a bad-pixel mask from a long-exposure dark by
    thresholding $+$/$-$ 5 clipped standard deviations about the clipped
    mean.
  \item [\htmlref{MEASURE\_READNOISE}{MEASURE\_READNOISE}]
    This is the second UIST-specific recipe replacing ARRAY\_TESTS.
    This recipe measures the readnoise for a group of UIST DARK frames
    and files that measurement with the calibration system.  If this recipe 
    is run in a UKIRT environment it will create or append to a log file
    located at {\tt/ukirt\_sw/logs/uist\_array\_tests.log}.
  \item [\htmlref{NOD\_SKY\_FLAT\_THERMAL}{NOD\_SKY\_FLAT\_THERMAL}]
    This is like \htmlref{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK}{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK},
    but it expects that the nod throws alternate to sky.  The sky frames
    alone make the flat.
\end{description}

\subsection{Modified recipes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \htmlref{ARRAY\_TESTS}{ARRAY\_TESTS}~~
    The log file is now called {\tt$<$instrument$>$\_array\_tests.log}
    where {\tt$<$instrument$>$} is the lowercase instrument name.
  \item \htmlref{NOD\_CHOP\_FAINT}{NOD\_CHOP\_FAINT}~~
    There is now an option to create and display a quality map of the
    combined source images.
  \item \htmlref{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK}{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK}~~
    This recipe and
    \htmlref{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK\_APHOT}{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK\_APHOT}
    now do not clean deviant pixels from the individual frames
    contributing to the flat.  Bad pixels in the mosaic are not filled.
    The difference-pair frames (suffix {\tt\_dp}) are no longer removed
    upon recipe completion.
  \item \htmlref{REDUCE\_DARK}{REDUCE\_DARK}~~
    This now supports variance creation and propagation by default.
    There is a new steering parameter USEVAR to disable this.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Global changes}

The main changes from a user perspective were as follows.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Updated and expanded documentation, particularly the 
   \htmlref{description of the primitives}{features_of_the_primitives}
   and lists the main primitives used at each stage, mention of
   \xref{{\bf xoracdr}}{sun230}{xoracdr}, and many more hyperlinks.

   \item Introduction of environment variable {\tt ORAC\_KEEP} to retain
   intermediate frames.

   \item Environment variables {\tt ORAC\_DATA\_IN} and {\tt ORAC\_DATA\_OUT}
   can define paths relative to the current working directory.

   \item {\bf xoracdr} now knows the default calibrarions for all
   instruments.  A bug which prevented {\bf xoracdr} operating on
   non-networked computers is fixed.

   \item Calibration reference offset added for off-centre nod patterns.
   This and the baseshift offset used array references.  Arrays of
   values in a {\tt -calib} can be comma separated.
   
   \item A bug affecting ORACTIME in calibrations for Michelle fixed;
   it was previously set to 0 in all cases.

   \item Cater for early Michelle data which had missing metadata
   affecting six headers.  Allow for missing, undefined, or malformed
   RA\_BASE and DEC\_BASE headers in \UFTI\ data.

   \item Allow for old UFTI data with CTYPE1 header set erroneously to 
   {\tt 'Detector Rows'} to create WCS.
   
   \item For \IRIS, modify the header translations for filter name 
   and observation mode; correct the airmass calculation; and allow
   alternate frames to have alternate files, but still be members of the
   same group by using different headers for group membership checks.

   \item There is no longer the assumption of a right-handed world
   co-ordinate system in co-ordinate transformations benefitting UIST
   and future instruments with an extra reflection in the optical train.

   \item There are additional checks for significantly negative frame
   means after dark subtraction.  Depending on the severity this may
   stop the pipeline, or merely issue a warning.  This is to ensure
   that valid darks are observed.

   \item The broadened mean method has been reinstated for combining
   frames into a flat.  This avoids the artefact in self-flat fielding
   where in an $n$-point jitter pattern, 1/$n$ pixels divide by
   themselves giving rise to a false peak at the normalisation factor
   in the histogram of values in a flat-fielded frame.

   \item A possible cause of cause of a negative mode in is given in
   the warning announnced by \_NORMALISE\_TO\_MODE\_.
   
   \item \_GENERATE\_OFFSETS\_EXTENDED\_ now uses the 98 percentile,
   the same as the other \_GENERATE\_OFFSETS\_ primitives.
   
   \item Centroiding now has a default smoothing option to make
   object location more robust for fainter sources.

   \item A double-pass median filtering of bad pixels now occurs just prior
   to the near-infra-red photometry to reduce bias from unmeasured flux.
   It particulalry helps the flat-fielded images, as the mosaics 
   almost invariably lose their bad pixels in the region of interest
   during their formation.
  
   \item If variance information is available, the aperture photometry
   uses it to estimate photometric errors.

   \item Tidying correctly erases NDF components within HDS container
   files.  Allow for {\tt \_bc} files in relevant \_TIDY\_ primitives.

   \item Support added to remove electronic ghosting, correct residual
   bias, and resample for field distortion, all initially for \ISAAC.
\end{itemize}

The main changes from a programmer perspective were as follows.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Calibration index files permit user header (uhdr) to be in
   expressions for bias, dark, flat, and sky.

   \item Infrastructure uses perl modules {\tt Astro::FITS::Header} for access
   to FITS headers, and {\tt Starlink::HDSPACK} for manipulation of HDS components.

   \item Add the internal headers ORAC\_TELESCOPE, 
   ORAC\_X\_REFERENCE\_PIXEL, and ORAC\_Y\_REFERENCE\_PIXEL.

   \item There is a {\tt\$Grp->memberindex( \$Frm )} method which returns
   the position the supplied frame has in the group, starting from 0.
   This is useful in batch-mode processing where the groups are pre-populated.

   \item \_CLIPPED\_STATS\_ has new NUMBER argument returning the
   number of good pixels.

   \item \_DIVIDE\_BY\_FLAT\_CHOP\_SKY\_ and \_DIVIDE\_BY\_FLAT\_EXTENDED\_
   permit flat-fielding of sky frames via a new argument FLATSKY.

   \item There are some new primitives including \_GET\_FILTER\_PARAMETERS\_ to
   encapsulate filter attributes, and \_FORM\_SKY\_LEVELS\_ to
   determine the modal sky level for the sky frames after flat-fielding.

   \item Script {\tt nongeneric\_imaging.csh} is moved from the {\tt etc/} to the
   new {\tt admin/} directory.

   \item Lexical handles rather than global variables are used for accessing files.
   
\end{itemize}

{{\stardocname}~--- Release Notes---V3.1-1}

The main change is the addition of support for IRIS2.

\subsection{New recipes}
\begin{description}
  \item [\htmlref{ADDWCS}{ADDWCS}]
    Adds a valid WCS in the FITS headers of raw data.  This recipe
    is for all instruments.
  \item [ARRAY\_TESTS]
    This is for IRIS2.  It calculates and reports the readnoise and
    dark current using a group of four frames taken in the array
    tests sequence.  The readnoise and dark current are logged to
    a text file, and the readnoise is filed with the calibration system.
  \item [\htmlref{DARK\_SUBTRACT}{DARK\_SUBTRACT}]
    Subtracts a dark frame from an observation.  This recipe is meant
    for a quick look of data that are being taken at a high rate.
  \item [\htmlref{NOD\_CHOP\_FAINT}{NOD\_CHOP\_FAINT}]
    Reduction of nodded and chopped data, specifically for Michelle.
    It is similar to \htmlref{NOD\_CHOP}{NOD\_CHOP}, but first removes
    horizontal and vertical artifacts from the mosaic, then forms a single
    image of the source using a median filter, and finally smooths the
    combined image to enhance the visibility of faint sources.
  \item [\htmlref{NOD\_CHOP\_SCAN}{NOD\_CHOP\_SCAN}]
    Reduction of nodded and chopped data taken in a scan pattern,
    specifically for Michelle.  It is similar to NOD\_CHOP, but will
    create a mosaic from nodded and chopped groups taken in a scan
    pattern.
  \item [\htmlref{REDUCE\_FLAT}{REDUCE\_FLAT}]
    Reduces a flat field by masking bad pixels, subtracting a dark,
    and normalising the result.  This recipe is for all instruments.
\end{description}

\subsection{Modified recipes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \htmlref{NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT}{NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT}~~
    The photometry aperture has been increased to 5 arcseconds from 3,
    and inner and outer diameters of the sky annulus have been modified
    correspondingly.  The reported photometry uses filter zero points
    and widths, the latter to find and report the broadband-$N$
    equivalent magnitude and flux for narrowband-$N$ filters. 
    Extinctions are now included.
    
    The recipe now determines the baseshift calibration, which
    measures the displacement of the source images from the nominal
    locations.

  \item \htmlref{ARRAY\_TESTS}{ARRAY\_TESTS}~~
    For Michelle the estimated readout noise is no longer reported.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Global changes}

The main changes from a user perspective were as follows.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Undefined or nonsense headers used by the recipes are
   replaced internally to pipeline, but not in the physical files,
   This usually permits the pipeline to complete.   Recipes report
   the names of modified headers, for manual checking and correction
   of the raw data. 
   
   \item Further sanity checks are included for Michelle.  The
   waveform header is validated, and incorrect combinations reported.
   The mean data value must lie between 25000 and 48000 counts to
   prevent a warning message from appearing.

   \item Recipes make an on-the-fly night log in {\tt \$ORAC\_DATA\_OUT}.
   Night logs contain the group number.  The file name has an
   {\tt \_im} suffix for Michelle.

   \item The default UFTI gain reflects the gain's changing values arising
   from the use of a different controller.
   
   \item NDF blank titles are removed.

   \item The UFTI bad-pixel mask has changed, now having 0.3\% more
   bad pixels.

   \item Centroiding is protected against data comprising all bad
   values.

   \item The hybrid registration has a further improvement for a special
   case.
   
   \item The near-infrared photometry uses the latest standards list,
   which also includes standards for the $IZJHKLM$ wavebands.  

   \item In photometry recipes the sky units are now reported as
   counts/s/pixel.

   \item Scripts have improved error detection and reporting after accessing
   text files.

   \item The default display suffices have been augmented.  These are
   for Michelle {\tt\_cab}, {\tt\_scab}, {\tt\_cpc}, and {\tt\_rpc}; and
   {\tt\_dk} for IRCAM.

   \item The calibration called mask, should be used to specify other
   than the default bad-pixel mask, rather than the bpm calibration.
\end{itemize}

The main changes from a programmer perspective were as follows.

\begin{itemize}
   \item There is better structuring of the preliminary steps to
         permit instrument-specific variants, such as correcting the
         world co-ordinate system headers.

   \item The waveplate angle header values are standardised to a
         single format.

   \item The preliminary operation includes the removal of axes
         after a rearrangement in \\
         ORAC::Convert.

   \item The registration was modified to allow for changes to
         \xref{\CCDPACK}{sun139}{}.

   \item The \_COMBINE\_CHOPPED\_FRAME\_ primitive as used by the
         NOD\_CHOP family of recipes has new options.  These comprise
         centroiding with validation, the method by which the
         individual chopped and nodded images are combined, 
         the ability to apply block smoothing for faint sources,
         and the removal of pickup and bias variations.  The
         removes column then row patterns, by subtracting the
         median of each column or row from all the values in that
         column or row. 
\end{itemize}

{{\stardocname}~--- Release Notes---V3.0-3}

The main changes are the addition of recipes for Michelle nodded and
chopped observations, and a rearranged directory structure for new and
multi-mode instruments.

\subsection{New recipes}
\begin{description}
   \item [ARRAY\_TESTS]
      This is for Michelle.  It derives a mean bias file, and
      calculates and reports the read noise, using the latter pair of
      minimum-exposure frames in the array tests sequence.  Both the
      bias frame and readnoise are recorded in the calibration system.
   \item [\htmlref{NOD\_CHOP}{NOD\_CHOP}]
      Reduction of nodded and chopped data, specifically for Michelle.
      Each recipe cycle comprises four frames located at two nod
      positions and the A and B beams.  The individual beams are
      differenced and then so are successive pairs of observations.
      The differenced images are then combined into a mosaic.  On
      successive cycles the mosaics are co-added.
   \item [\htmlref{NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT}{NOD\_CHOP\_APHOT}]
      As \htmlref{NOD\_CHOP}{NOD\_CHOP}, but it also extracts, registers,
      and combines the two positive and two negative images of the
      source. Then it performs 3-arcsecond aperture photometry on the
      combined image, logging to a small text list.  It compares the
      object name against a file of $N,Q$ standards to determine the
      zero point.  No extinction correciton is currently applied, as
      the coefficients have yet to be determined.
   \item [\htmlref{MOVING\_NOD\_CHOP}{MOVING\_NOD\_CHOP}]
      As \htmlref{NOD\_CHOP}{NOD\_CHOP}, but mosaic registration
      is adjusted to track the motion of an asteroid or compact comet
      using ephemeris data. 
   \item [\htmlref{POL\_ANGLE\_NOD\_CHOP}{POL\_ANGLE\_NOD\_CHOP}]
      Reduces chopped and nodded poliarmetry data of point and small
      ($<\sim10$ arcsec) extended sources, specifically for Michelle.
      The data are expects to iterate over waveplate angle before the
      telescope is nodded.  The recipe forms integrating mosaics as
      \htmlref{NOD\_CHOP}{NOD\_CHOP}, for each of four waveplate
      angles.  For each mosaic it combines the two positive and two
      negative images of the source.  The recipe then calculates
      polarisation frames and catalogues of vectors from these as
      earlier recipes like \htmlref{POL\_JITTER}{POL\_JITTER}.
    \item [\htmlref{POL\_NOD\_CHOP}{POL\_NOD\_CHOP}]
      As \htmlref{POL\_ANGLE\_NOD\_CHOP}{POL\_ANGLE\_NOD\_CHOP},
      except the data are ordered such that the telescope performs
      its nodding pattern before the waveplate is turned.
\end{description}

\subsection{Modified recipes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \htmlref{ARRAY\_TESTS}{ARRAY\_TESTS}~~
       Instrument-specific versions for UFTI and IRCAM.  Both record the
       read noise in the calibration system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Global changes}

The main changes from a user perspective were as follows.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Correct data variance creation for UKIRT infra-red data.  The
         previous calculations were for CCD data.
   \item Easier to switch on data-variance processing.  This combined
         with handling of chopped data has caused some reordering of
	 the early steps; for instance the editing of the world
	 co-ordinate system (WCS) occurs just before dark subtraction,
	 rather than immediately after the \_IMAGING\_HELLO\_
	 preliminaries.  Thus a few of the early frames such as
	 {\tt\_db} and {\tt\_bp} now do not have a WCS defined.
   \item More-efficient masking using \EXTRACTOR\ instead of \PISA.
         Some of the acceleration is because some of the steps to
	 sweeten the data for \PISA, such as the removal of the bad
	 pixels, are now unnecessary.
   \item Flat-field creation now uses an unweighted median to give 
         approximately equal weighting to the contributing frames. 
         The previous version of \xref{MAKEFLAT}{sun139}{MAKEFLAT} was
         supposed to weight the values but had bugs.  The corrected
         task weights by the data value in the absence of a variance
         array assuming pure Poisson statistics, which is in appropriate
         for infra-red data.  The unweighted median gives similar
         results to earlier \ORACDR\ versions.  There is a beneficial
         exception where the earlier MAKEFLAT biassed towards certain
         contributing frames, and the unweighted median gives a more
         equitable division.
   \item An improved option for registration is available, although it
         is not the default.  It uses the WCS to only compare sources
         in the overlap regions, and permits a match using a single source,
         provided it is within 12 pixels of the nominal WCS position. 
   \item For moving-target registration and the ephemeris file, a bug
         affecting object names containing spaces is fixed.
   \item Better formatting of output with blank lines to block related
         output, and some of the commentary contain more details.  The
         historical and unnecessary "Orac says: " prefix was removed
         from the commentary.
   \item The nearest-neighbour registration immediately prior to forming
         a mosaic had assumed that the brightest object with
         identification number 1 would be present in all the offset
	 files.  In rare cases, this may not be true.  For instance,
	 if the centred target is a faint or low surface-brightness
	 galaxy at low galactic latitude, brighter stars relegate the
	 galaxy to a high identification number.  So the code now
	 checks for a common-denominator object between all the frames
	 with a higher identification number. 
   \item The mosaic-making primitive has been partly restructured to
         make the code more obvious, and it also rationalises the
         naming.  Gone is the {\tt\_mu} file.  The mosaic with bad
	 pixels filled has its own {\tt\_fb} suffix.  All
	 individual-cycle mosaics are retained.  The only disadvantage
	 is that for a single-cycle observation, there are two copies
	 of the same mosaic, one with suffix {\tt\_mos} and the other
	 with suffix {\tt\_mos\_0}; the recipe cannot know if there
         is a second cycle to come.
   \item The mosaics have the world co-ordinate system domain set to sky
         so that displays with \xref{\GAIA}{sun214}{} and 
         \xref{\KAPPA}{sun95}{} have sky co-ordinates.
   \item The start and end UT times for mosaics are updated to that of
         the first- and last-contributing frames.
   \item The photometry results file now reports the sky in counts per
         second (previously just counts), and the exposure time.  The
         alignment of the columns is thus slightly altered.
   \item The recipe tidying has been improved to remove all unwanted
         files.  Some of the registration text files, certain suffices,
         and later-cycle frames were being missed.
   \item In the polarimetry calculations, the chip position angle is
         added to the offset of north with respect to the analyser,
         so that the vectors are also measured with respect to north. 
         This omission had been giving vector orientations approximately
         89 degrees too high for IRCAM.
   \item More allowance for occasional problems with the headers in the
         raw data, {\em e.g.}\ the base R.A. in degrees not hours and
         defunct instrument read modes.
   \item In earlier versions, there were fatal errors which the recipes
         reported, but allowed the pipeline to continue.  These are now
         corrected so that the recipe ends its processing.
   \item Expanded tutorial documentation, particularly of the description
         of algorithms used by the primitives and more hyperlinks, and
         updated for the new directory structure.  Various minor
         improvements, new hyperlinks and corrections to the recipe
         documentation.
\end{itemize}

The main changes from a programmer perspective were as follows.

\begin{itemize}
   \item The primitives access user headers for steering.
   \item The FITS header information is accessed through generic user
         headers with the prefix {\tt ORAC\_}.  This insulation
         permits common code for multiple instruments.
   \item There were upgrades for the latest versions of \KAPPA\ and
         \ARD, notably for further use of the world co-ordinate system.
         In general recipes use the pixel domain for tasks like 
         \xref{CENTROID}{sun95}{CENTROID} and \xref{PSF}{sun95}{PSF},
         recording the former domain, and then resetting WCS frame
         after using the \KAPPA\ task.
   \item There is a reorganised directory structure for the recipes
         and primitives.  These are divided into instrument-specific;
         general; or by topic, such as imaging or spectroscopy.  The
         topic directories also have subdirectories for specific instruments.
         This restructuring permits code reuse for current and new instruments.
         It is also now possible to have recipes and primitives with the same
         name for different topics or instrument.  Such scripts do have
         similar functions, but the exact processing depends on the
         data topic or some instrument attribute.
\end{itemize}

{{\stardocname}~--- Release Notes---V2.1-0}

The main changes are the addition of spatially jittered Fabry-Perot
recipes, and recipes for compact comets.

\subsection{New recipes}
\begin{description}
   \item [\htmlref{FP\_JITTER}{FP\_JITTER}]
      Reduction of a Fabry-Perot observation, comprising eight frames,
      on and off the source, and on and off the spectral line both to
      the blue and to the red.  This is repeated for a series of spatial
      positions of the source.
   \item [\htmlref{FP\_JITTER\_NO\_SKY}{FP\_JITTER\_NO\_SKY}]
      Reduction of a Fabry-Perot observation, comprising four frames,
      all on the source, and on and off the spectral line both to
      the blue and to the red.  This is repeated for a series of spatial
      positions of the source.
   \item [\htmlref{MOVING\_QUADRANT\_JITTER}{MOVING\_QUADRANT\_JITTER}]
      As \htmlref{QUADRANT\_JITTER}{QUADRANT\_JITTER} but registration
      is adjusted to track the motion of a comet using ephemeris
      data.  The comet should $<$45 arcsec diameter for UFTI, or $<$10
      arcsec for IRCAM.  Compared with 
      \htmlref{MOVING\_JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT}{MOVING\_JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT}, 
      this recipe avoids cometary artifacts appearing in the flat field.
   \item [\htmlref{QUADRANT\_JITTER\_TELE}{QUADRANT\_JITTER\_TELE}]
      As QUADRANT\_JITTER, but registers using the telescope offsets.
      This is used for observing compact comets (limiting angular
      sizes as above), when the telescope has tracked the
      nucleus.
\end{description}

\subsection{Modified recipes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \htmlref{ARRAY\_TESTS}{ARRAY\_TESTS}
       For UFTI, the ADU conversion is obtained from the GAIN header,
       rather than being hardwired at 7.0.
    \item \htmlref{CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER}{CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER}
       This now functions correctly for multiple cycles of the recipe.
    \item \htmlref{FP}{FP}
       Documentation improvements especially in the description.
       Primitive \_FP\_STEER\_ has a new steering parameter, NPAIRS,
       and parameter NUMBER has changed to its normal meaning.
    \item \htmlref{NIGHT\_LOG}{NIGHT\_LOG}
       This can start from observation numbers other than 1.  A bug
       has been fixed where the dimensions appeared as zero for UFTI.
       It arose because certain headers no longer existed after 2000
       August.
    \item \htmlref{SKY\_FLAT\_FP}{SKY\_FLAT\_FP}
       This is no longer limited to eight frames.
    \item \htmlref{SKY\_AND\_JITTER}{SKY\_AND\_JITTER}
       A bug has been fixed where some intermediate files were not being
       removed for this recipe and its variant.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Global changes}

The main changes from a user perspective were as follows.

\begin{itemize}
   \item The aperture for \_APHOT recipes is now 5 arcseconds.
   \item A new photometry catalogue {\tt fs2001.dat}, supplied in
      original form by Sandy Leggett, is used by the \_APHOT recipes.
      The new catalogue contains $IZLM$ magnitudes for the first time,
      and the $JHK$ data have been refined to account for recent
      observations.  The 2000 edition is accessed for $JHK$ photometry
      if the 2001 catalogue is unavailable. 
   \item Another new UFTI bad-pixel mask.  Old masks are available on
      request.
   \item A bug that affected some rare mixed-method registrations has
      been fixed.  The $y$ offset had the wrong sign.
   \item Allow for a special case in the mosaicking registration, when
      the nearest-neighbour method is used to align the various images,
      {\em{and}} an automatic multiple-object registration was found.
      It was possible not to find a common object identifier in all
      the fields when the target is a low-surface brightness galaxy.
      While this is still possible, it is far less likely than before.
   \item The IRCAM saturation level was refined upwards to 20000, or
      33000 if header SPD\_GAIN is {\tt{"Deepwell"}}.  SPD\_GAIN
      is created by the recipe when it is absent, based upon the value
      of the detector bias.
   \item The message concerning an AST SKY Frame creation,
      which could be confused with a data frame of blank sky, has been
      clarified.  The same script allows for a missing CROTA2 header
      in old data when inserting world co-ordinate system headers.
   \item Various minor improvements and corrections to the
      documentation, such as correcting the former prefix for UFTI
      mosaics in the reference section, and excluding references to
      IRCAM in the FP recipes.
\end{itemize}

\markboth{{\stardocname}~ --- Release Notes---V2.0-0}
{{\stardocname}~ --- Release Notes---V2.0-0}

The major changes are the move to generic recipes, and the introduction
of many new recipes, especially for polarimetry and Fabry-Perot data.

\subsection{New recipes}
\begin{description}
   \item [\htmlref{CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER}{CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER}]
      Reduction of alternating sky-target jitters for extended objects
      of size comparable to the detector's field of view.
   \item [\htmlref{CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER\_BASIC}{CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER\_BASIC}]
      A basic (faster) version of CHOP\_SKY\_JITTER.
   \item [\htmlref{FP}{FP}]
      Reduction of a Fabry-Perot observation, without jittering.
   \item [\htmlref{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT\_NCOLOUR}{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT\_NCOLOUR}]
      Reduction of multi-colour standard jitters.  This will become
      the new JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT once the recipes are colour generic.
   \item [\htmlref{POL\_ANGLE\_JITTER}{POL\_ANGLE\_JITTER}]
      Reduces an imaging polarimetry observation, in which the
      waveplate angle iterates at each jitter position.
   \item [\htmlref{POL\_EXTENDED}{POL\_EXTENDED}]
      Reduces an imaging polarimetry observation of an extended
      source.
   \item [\htmlref{POL\_JITTER}{POL\_JITTER}]
      Reduces an imaging polarimetry observation, in which the
      spatial is position jittered before moving the waveplate
      angle.
   \item [\htmlref{SKY\_FLAT\_FP}{SKY\_FLAT\_FP}]
      Creates and files a Fabry-Perot flat field derived from eight
      frames, using object masking.
   \item [\htmlref{SKY\_FLAT\_POL}{SKY\_FLAT\_POL}]
      Creates a polarimetry flat field derived from eight frames
      (two at each waveplate angle), using object masking.  It copies
      the flat for each waveplate angle and files them.
   \item [\htmlref{SKY\_FLAT\_POL\_ANGLE}{SKY\_FLAT\_POL\_ANGLE}]
      Creates and files polarimetry flat fields derived from jittered
      frames at each waveplate angle, using object masking.
\end{description}

\subsection{Modified recipes}
Many former recipes had numerous variants for different jitter sizes.
These have largely been superseded by generic equivalents.  Only the
EXTENDED recipes await conversion.  The families of recipes changed
are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \htmlref{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT}{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT} 
          (Six recipes in the family)  There were three-,
          five-, seven-, and nine-point versions, but most were only
          available for one or two recipe variants.
    \item \htmlref{MOVING\_JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT}{MOVING\_JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT} 
          (Two recipes)  These were limited to nine-point jitters.
    \item \htmlref{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK}{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK}
          (Four recipes) There were limited to fixed sizes of four- and
          eight-point jitters.
    \item \htmlref{SKY\_AND\_JITTER}{SKY\_AND\_JITTER} (Two recipes)
          Only five-point jitters were available.
\end{itemize}

In addition certain recipes had a fixed jitter size, but no longer.
These families are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \htmlref{BRIGHT\_POINT\_SOURCE}{BRIGHT\_POINT\_SOURCE} (Two recipes)
       These were formerly restricted to five-point jitters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Global changes}

The main changes from a user perspective were as follows.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Recipes and primitives are instrument generic.
   \item \htmlref{Improved registration}{automatic_registration} allowing
      mixed solutions.  There is a new offset type---beam
      separa\-tions---for combining polarimetry mosaics.
   \item \htmlref{Thresholding}{bad_pixels} of dark-subtracted data
      to prevent bizarre values affecting the pipeline processing.
      In addition \htmlref{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT}{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT} and
      \htmlref{SKY\_FLAT}{SKY\_FLAT} recipes and their variants which
      use object masking to make a flat, now have the deviant pixels of
      the initial flat-field frame reflagged as bad.
   \item Editing of the FITS headers to create a world co-ordinate
      system which \xref{\GAIA}{sun214}{} and \xref{\KAPPA}{sun95}{}
      recognise.  Also pre-ORAC IRCAM data have their headers
      structured and comments edited to bring them closer towards the
      \htmladdnormallink{UKIRT FITS
      standard}{http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/UKIRT/software/orac/docs/orac016-fith.fm.A4.ps},
      and to make the headers easier to read and comprehend.
   \item The names of flats have changed.  The filter name is included
      for easy identification.  Certain characters have special
      meaning to HDS, therefore {\tt []\{\}} are removed and a decimal
      point becomes a {\tt p} in the flat's name.  The {\tt{\_cycle}}
      suffix is shortened to {\tt{\_c}}, and all {\tt{\_subgrp}}
      strings removed from the group number.  Flats are are not
      combined over multiple cycles over recipes.  SKY\_FLAT and
      SKY\_FLAT\_MASKED are limited to jitters between three to five
      points for compatibility with other ORAC tools.  It is still
      possible to make private variants of these recipes in which the
      number of jitter positions is set by the NUMBER steering
      parameter.
   \item Mosaics are combined using the mean at each pixel.  This was
      formerly the median.  The change was made to correct the
      photometry.  Poor registration from telescope offsets due to
      sparse fields leads to multiple peaks in the mosaic's grid, and
      given the steep point-spread function's profile, the median
      preferentially selects pixels not at a peak.  This resulted in a
      typical underestimate of the flux of standard stars by 1--3\%.
      The \_MAKE\_MOSAIC\_ primitive now has an argument to select
      various estimators should you prefer not to use the mean.
   \item For the aperture photometry the default sky annulus radii
      have been increased.  This reduces the error estimating the sky
      level, both statistically and from the extend low-level pedestal
      in the point-spread function.  The area is increased 2.9$\times$
      for IRCAM and 5.6$\times$ for UFTI. 
   \item To counteract the spike artifact in the histogram of sky values
      of flat-fielded frames where the pre-flattened frame itself
      contributed to the flat (`self-flat' recipes), the mode is
      now calculated using multiple standard-deviation clipping for
      \htmlref{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT\_APHOT}{JITTER\_SELF\_FLAT\_APHOT} and
      \htmlref{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK\_APHOT}{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK\_APHOT}.
      The previous estimation was from iterative application of
      Chauvenet's criterion and using the \mbox{3 $\lsk$ median $-$ 2 $\lsk$ mean}
      formula, and lead to a underestimate of the sky level.  For
      typical standard stars this systematic error led to a
      brightening of 1--2\%.  The latter method is still used for
      photometric recipes which do not self flat, such as
      \htmlref{BRIGHT\_POINT\_SOURCE\_APHOT}{BRIGHT\_POINT\_SOURCE\_APHOT}.
      If you create and apply a `superflat', the artifact is much
      reduced and therefore, the former estimator is appropriate.
   \item More and better processing-status messages.  For example, all
      floating-point numbers are now reported with a sensible number of
      decimal places, and the names of calibration frames are reported.
   \item Addition of FWHM to the aperture photometry results and small
      text list.  The file name column is 3 characters wider to
      accommodate the positive and negative suffices of recipe
      \htmlref{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK\_APHOT}{NOD\_SELF\_FLAT\_NO\_MASK\_APHOT}.
   \item The saturation level in the aperture photometry was a constant.
      Now it is set to the appropriate value by instrument and mode.
   \item It is possible to use versions of \KAPPA\  other than the
     latest.  The changed argument lists in various tasks are adjusted
     for the \KAPPA\  version.
   \item More intermediate files, mostly the text files, are removed.
   \item Pipeline activates two more application engines: \POLPACK\ and 
      {\footnotesize CATSELECT}.
   \item A new UFTI bad-pixel mask.
   \item Added waveplate angle to flat rules file ({\tt\$ORAC\_DATA\_CAL/rules.flat}).
        The angle defaults to zero if it does not have a value in the FITS
        headers.
   \item Bug fixes and documentation improvements, especially links in
      the Perl POD.
