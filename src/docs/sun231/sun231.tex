\section{Introduction\xlabel{introduction}}

The ORAC Data Reduction pipeline (\oracdr) is a general purpose pipeline for
reducing data from any instrument. A set of data reduction recipes are
available for use with reducing data from the Submillimetre Common-User
Bolometer Array (SCUBA) \cite{mnscu} at the \htmladdnormallinkfoot{James Clerk
Maxwell Telescope}{http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/JCMT/}, Mauna Kea,
Hawaii .  This document explains how to run the \oracdr\ data reduction
pipeline system on data taken with SCUBA.

Information on the general aspects of \oracdr\ (with more information on loop
control and the display system) can be found in document \oracsun.




\section{Pipeline Setup\xlabel{pipeline_setup}}

In order to configure the \oracdr\ SCUBA data reduction pipeline a setup
command, \texttt{oracdr\_scuba}, is provided. Assuming you are running the
command from the Unix \texttt{C-shell} this command sets all the
environment variables and command aliases required to run the pipeline.
The UT date of the observations can be specified by supplying an argument
to the command, if not specified the current UT date is assumed:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr_scuba 19990703
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}

In order for the startup script to be configured to read the
input data, an environment variable must be set which points
to the directory containing the UT date directory. For example,
if your data is in directory \texttt{/mydata/19991012} the following
is required:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% setenv ORAC_DATA_ROOT /mydata
% oracdr_scuba 19991012
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}

If \texttt{ORAC\_DATA\_ROOT} is not set then the current directory
will be assumed unless the script is run at the Joint Astronomy Centre.
With this variable unset when run at the Joint Astronomy Centre
the input data directory will be configured to point to the actual
SCUBA archive data directory.

When run, this command should list information detailing the
current setup. Hopefully, it should be obvious at this point
whether something has gone wrong. Here is an example for the JAC:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr_scuba 20000127
 
     ORAC Data Reduction Pipeline -- (ORAC-DR Version 1.0-0)
     Configured for instrument SCUBA
 
     Type "oracdr -h" for usage
     Type 'showme sun231' to browse the hypertext documentation
 
 
 Raw data will be read from /scuba/m99b/20000127/
 Reduced data will appear in /users/timj/oracdr/docs/sun231
 
+++++++++ For online SCUBA reduction use oracdr -loop wait +++++++++

For comments specific to SCUBA data reduction mail timj@jach.hawaii.edu
For problems with the ORAC-DR system mail helpme@jach.hawaii.edu
         http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT/software/oracdr/

\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}

A warning is printed if the input directory can not be found
on the system.

Once this is done, the next step is to set the location of the
output directory. By default, the directory from which the
\texttt{oracdr\_scuba} command was issued is chosen. In order
to override this value, the \texttt{ORAC\_DATA\_OUT} environment
variable must be set:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% setenv ORAC_DATA_OUT /largedisk/myoracata/
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}

All \oracdr\ output files will appear in \texttt{ORAC\_DATA\_OUT}.
For more information on the \oracdr\ environment variables please
see \xref{SUN/230}{sun230}{shell_variables}.

\section{Running ORAC-DR\xlabel{running_orac_dr}}

Once the environment has been configured the \texttt{oracdr} command
will be available. Help on the available command line options 
can be listed by invoking \texttt{oracdr -h}. In its simplest
form with no options, the pipeline will launch a logging window and 
start processing data from observation number 1 until no more data are
available. For example\footnote{On an xterm that supports ANSI colour (e.g.\
\texttt{dtterm}) the output from ORAC-DR is colour coded depending on the
source of the message}:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr
Orac says: No UT date supplied, using 19981001
ORAC says: Starting up monoliths...Done
Setting up display infrastructure (display tools will not
be started until necessary)...Done
No observation numbers supplied - starting from obs 1
Checking for next data file: 19981001_dem_0001.sdf....
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}
Note that the default setting is that \oracdr\ will use the current UT
date and start looking for observation number 1 in the ORAC\_DATA\_IN
directory. It will wait for data to appear until the timeout period expires 
(1 hour) or until the pipeline is aborted with CTRL-C. This behaviour
is equivalent to running \oracdr\ with the following options:
\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr -from 1 -loop wait
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}

In many cases this is the correct behaviour at the telescope. In order to
modify the behaviour of \oracdr\ command-line options can be used.

\subsection{Selecting a UT date}

The UT date is required so that the names of the raw data files can be
derived via observation numbers. The \textbf{-ut} option can be used
to specify the UT date of interest. For example,

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr -ut 19980715
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}

Currently, the pipeline can only process data from a single UT date in any
single invocation.  Data from multiple nights can not be coadded (even if they
are in the same directory since the filename is derived from the
UT)\footnote{This can be overcome by using soft links to rename the input files
-- see TJ for more information}.

In general, the \texttt{oracdr\_scuba} can be used to configure the
UT date so that the \texttt{-ut} flag will not be required.
Rerun \texttt{oracdr\_scuba} when data from a different UT date are to
be reduced.

\subsection{Choosing the observations}

In many cases only a subset of the data in ORAC\_DATA\_IN are to be
processed. \oracdr\ provides a number of ways of specifying observations
either as a range of observation numbers or as a list.

The options are:

\begin{description}
\item[-from] \mbox{}

Specify the number of the first observation to be processed. 
This option defaults to `1' if this option is omitted but the \textbf{-to} is
present.

\item[-to] \mbox{}

Specify the number of the last observation to be processed. If
the \textbf{-from} option is present but no \textbf{-to} option, then
all the data will be processed starting from \textbf{-from}.

\item[-list] \mbox{}

Specify a list of observations. This list should be comma-separated. Colons
can be used to indicate a range. For example, \textbf{-list 1,2,3,5:10,15}
would process observations 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10 and 15.

\end{description}

Here are some examples of selecting observations using \oracdr:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr -from 5
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}
Start at observation 5 and continue incrementing the observation number
until no more files are available.
\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr -from 5 -to 20
% oracdr -list 5:20
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}
Start at observation 5 and finish at observation 20.

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr -to 20
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}
Start at observation 1 and finish at observation 20.

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr -list 1,2,3,4,5,20:25,30:32
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}
Process observations 1,2,3,4,5,20,21,22,23,24,25,30,31 and 32.

\subsection{Looping schemes}

There are a number of different ways of dealing with the data detection
loop in \oracdr. If the system is being used `off-line', the data are
all present in the input directory and the pipeline assumes that no new
data will appear. In this case the \textit{list} and \textit{inf} detection
loops are supplied which stop processing when data files can no longer 
be found. These are the default loops whenever observation 
numbers are specified with \textit{list} being used in conjunction with the
\textbf{-list} and \textbf{-from/-to} options and \textit{inf} being
used in conjunction with the \textbf{-from} option.

At the telescope new data are continually arriving so a different detection
loop is required. The \textit{wait} loop is used 

Occasionally observation numbers are skipped (e.g.\ when an observation is
aborted and not copied to the Sun). In this case the \textbf{-skip} option
should be used. Without this option the data detection loop aborts when
an observation can not be found (or it continues to wait for a file even
though an observation with a higher number now exists).
It is probably a good idea to always use the \textbf{-skip}
option when processing SCUBA data.


\section{Calibration\label{sec:cal}\xlabel{calibration}}

The calibration system can be configured using the \textbf{-cal} option.
For SCUBA this option can be used to decide how to obtain the sky opacity,
which gains to use and which bolometers should be turned off.

Currently only photometry observations use gain calibration (e.g.\ the
SCUBA\_STD\_PHOTOM recipe for standard photometry)

The arguments to \textbf{-cal} should be comma-separated 
keyword=value pairs. The recognised keywords are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{gains} \mbox{}

This keyword controls the way that gain values are determined. The options
are:

\begin{description}
\item[default:] Use generic values for the gain (e.g.\ use 240 Jy/V at 850
microns). This is the default option.
\item[index:] Derive gains by using the gains index file. The index file
is updated every time a calibration observation is reduced (e.g.\ photometry
on a planet). The nearest calibration (in
time) will be used for the gain determination. An error will occur if
no calibration observation has been taken (or reduced) before an observation
is reduced.
\end{description}


\item \textbf{tausys} \mbox{}

This keyword controls the behaviour of the tau correction. The options
are:

\begin{description}
\item[CSO:] Derive taus for all wavelengths by using the CSO tau stored in the 
header of each frame. This only works if the CSO tau is being updated.
\item[skydip:] Derive taus by using the skydip index file. The index file
is updated every time a skydip observation is reduced. The nearest skydip (in
time) will be used for the extinction correction. 
If no skydip observation has been taken (or reduced) before an observation
is reduced the CSO tau value will be used. Warnings are issued if the
selected skydip was taken more than 3 hours from the current
observation. 
\textbf{index} is an allowed synonym for \textbf{skydip}.
\item[a number:] If a number is given it is assumed to be a CSO tau value.
A value of 0.0 will turn off extinction correction.
\item[850skydip:] Derive taus by using the 850 skydip values. Tau values
from other filters are all derived from the 850 value using the standard
tau ratios. If no suitable skydip can be found the CSO tau value will be
used. Warnings are issued if the
selected skydip was taken more than 3 hours from the current
observation. 
\item[dipinterp \& 850dipinterp:] Same as \textbf{skydip} and
\textbf{850skydip} except values either side of the current observation
are interpolated to find the current tau. This is \emph{not} the same as
specifying two tau values to the \SURF\ \extinction\ task since that
will calculate the interpolated tau throughout the time of the observation
rather than just calculating the value for the start. If only one value can
be found then that value is used; if no values are found then CSO will
be used. Warnings are issued if skydips were taken more than 3 hours from
the current observation.
\end{description}

\item \textbf{badbols} \mbox{}

This keyword controls the selection of bad bolometers (i.e.\ bolometers
turned off by the pipeline). The options are:

\begin{description}
\item[index:] Uses an index file containing bad bolometers. The index
file is written by the \texttt{SCUBA\_NOISE} recipe and contains a list
of all bolometers that had noise (from REFLECTOR observations) greater than
the specified threshold limit (currently the default threshold is 100nV).
\item[file:] Uses a file \verb|badbol.lis| found
in ORAC\_DATA\_OUT.
The file should contain a single line containing a space-separated list
of bolometer names\footnote{Bolometer numbers can not be used since that
depends on the sub-instrument in use}. The file may contain a line such as:
\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
A1 E2 H7 I5
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}
This is the default system.
\item[a list of bolometers:] Finally, it is possible to specify a list of 
bolometer names. This list should be colon-separated, e.g.: `H7:A2:b3'

\end{description}

\end{itemize}

Here are some examples:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr -cal tausys=skydip
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}
Derive opacities from the index file but use the default gains.
\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr -cal gains=index,tausys=0.08
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}
Use a constant value for the opacity and use the derived gains
from the index file.
\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
% oracdr -cal tausys=850dipinterp
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}
Use the 850 micron skydips either side of an observation 
to derive all taus. Use the standard gain values.
\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}

Turn off bolometers a3 and c14.


\section{Recipes\xlabel{recipes}}

Data reduction recipes exist for processing data from the standard SCUBA
observing modes. This does limit the flexibility of any given recipe since
they are designed to work for any data from that mode. Occasionally it is
necessary to modify recipes (e.g.\ change the sky bolometers or size of pixels to
be used for the rebinning) and this can be achieved in a number of ways:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Specify a new recipe name on the command line. This is fine
for reducing observations taken in the same way but should not be used
in the general case since this command line argument overrides all 
recipe choices regardless of observation mode.

\item Create a recipe with a different name and store this name
in the header before the observation is taken. This is done by using 
the \texttt{DRRECIPE} ODF parameter.

\item Create a recipe with a different name and modify the \texttt{DRRECIPE}
FITS header value using the \Kappa\ \fitsmod\ command.


\item Use the ORAC\_RECIPE\_DIR environment variable. This variable should be
set before running up \oracdr\ and provides a search path that is used to
locate recipes. When \oracdr\ attempts to read a recipe it first looks in
ORAC\_RECIPE\_DIR, then in ORAC\_DIR/recipes/SCUBA (the default location) and
finally in the current directory (which will be ORAC\_DATA\_OUT).

In order to modify a recipe, it should be copied from the default location
(ORAC\_DIR/recipes/SCUBA) to ORAC\_RECIPE\_DIR and edited there. The next
time \oracdr\ tries to read the recipe the modified version will be used
in preference to the standard version.

\end{enumerate}

The standard SCUBA recipes are:

\begin{description}
\item[SCUBA\_NOISE] for noise observations
\item[SCUBA\_STD\_PHOTOM] for photometry observations
\item[SCUBA\_JIGMAP] for jiggle map reduction
\item[SCUBA\_POINTING] for array pointing observations
\item[SCUBA\_EM2SCAN] for SCAN/MAP data reduction using the Emerson II
technique \cite{EII}. 
\item[SCUBA\_SKYDIP] for skydip observations.
\item[SCUBA\_JIGPOLMAP] for array polarimetry (jiggle maps)
\item[SCUBA\_EKHSCAN] for scan/map data reduction using the EKH \cite{ekh} technique
\end{description}

Null recipes are provided for ALIGN, and FOCUS observations.


\section{Bad bolometers\xlabel{bad_bolometers}}

In some cases data are affected by the presence of excessively noisy
bolometers. To overcome this problem a facility is provided for turning
off specific bolometers so that they are ignored by the data reduction.

See the section on calibration (\S\ref{sec:cal}) for more information on how
to set bolometers to bad using the \texttt{badbols} calibration system.


\section{Bad observations\xlabel{bad_observations}}

In some cases, it is desirable to remove some frames (observations)
from a group. For example, you make 5 observations of a source
but you see that when the pipeline combines observation 3 into the
group the noise is dominated by this observation. In order
not to contaminate the group when observations 4 and 5 are coadded
the pipeline must be instructed to remove observation 3 from any further
group operations.

Observations can be turned off by using a special type of
ORAC-DR index file (cf. index files generated by skydip and
calibration observations).

This index file is called \texttt{index.badobs} and should be present in the
ORAC\_DATA\_OUT directory. It should contain a line for each observation to be
removed. Each line should contain the observation number and the 8 digit UT
date (YYYYMMDD), e.g.:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
55  19990128
62  19990129
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}



\section{Bad integrations\xlabel{bad_observations}}

Currently it is not possible to turn off specific integrations
using the pipeline.

\section{Processing specific sub-instruments\xlabel{processing_specific_sub_instruments}}

By default all sub-instruments are processed by the pipeline. In some
cases, e.g.\ where there is no hope of detecting anything at 450 microns, 
this is undesirable since this doubles the time required by the pipeline
to process each observation. To overcome this the recipe can be
edited to select specific sub-instruments as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Copy the recipe you are interested in to ORAC\_RECIPE\_DIR (create this
directory and set the environment variable if necessary). For example, for scan maps
copy SCUBA\_EM2SCAN from ORAC\_DIR/recipes/SCUBA to ORAC\_RECIPE\_DIR

\item Change the \_EXTINCTION\_CORRECT\_ line to `\_EXTINCTION\_CORRECT\_
SUBS=long' to only process the LONG sub-instrument. The SUBS argument
can take a comma-separated list (e.g.\ P2000,LONG to select 2mm and LONG).

\end{enumerate}

A modified recipe may look something like:

\begin{myquote}
\begin{verbatim}
_PRE_PROCESS_
_FLAT_FIELD_
_SET_BAD_PIXELS_
_DESPIKE_SCAN_
_EXTINCTION_CORRECT_ SUBS=long
_REMOVE_SCAN_BASELINE_
_REMOVE_SKY_NOISE_SCAN_
_REBIN_FRAME_ PIXEL_SIZE=3.0 REBIN_METHOD=GAUSSIAN
_REBIN_EM2_GROUP_ PIXEL_SIZE=1.0 REBIN_METHOD=GAUSSIAN
\end{verbatim}
\end{myquote}

\section{The ORAC display system\xlabel{the_orac_display_system}}

ORAC uses a fully configurable display system. By default the data 
display is turned on but can be turned off by using the \textbf{-nodisplay}
option when starting \oracdr. For a more general introduction to the
display system see \xref{SUN/230}{sun230}{display_system}.

The default configuration is to use \Kappa graphics commands via the 
\textsc{kapview}
monolith, and uses a single \xref{GWM}{sun219}{}/\xref{GKS}{sun83}{} window
split into sections. For mapping observations the individual reduced frames
are displayed in the top two quadrants and reduced groups displayed in the
lower quadrants (only one quadrant is used per sub-instrument). For skydips
and photometry observations the display is split into two horizontal regions.

\subsection{Display systems}

The \oracdr\ display interface currently can use \Kappa\ and
\gaia\footnote{The \xref{\textsc{p4}}{sun27}{} display engine is also supported, but
its use is deprecated}. The \gaia\ interface can only support image display
whereas the \Kappa\ (KAPVIEW) interface can support imaging, graphs, scatter
plots and vector plots.

\subsection{Display types}

\oracdr\ can be configured to use the following display types:

\begin{description}
\item[IMAGE:] Display an 2-D image file. The X,Y and Z limits can be
specified or autoscaling can be used. Supported by \gaia, KAPVIEW and P4.
\item[GRAPH:] Display a 1-D data set as a line graph. Supported by KAPVIEW and 
P4
\item[SIGMA:] Display a data set as a scatter plot with a Y-range specified in 
sigmas and horizontal dashed lines at a specific sigma range 
(useful for photometry data - equivalent to the \SURF\ routine \qdraw) (KAPVIEW
only) 
\item[DATAMODEL:] Display a 1-D data set (as points) with a model (as a solid
line). Designed for displaying skydip results. (KAPVIEW only)
\item[HISTOGRAM:] Show a histogram of all data (KAPVIEW only)
\item[VECTOR:] Show vectors on top of an image (KAPVIEW only)
\end{description}

\subsection{Configuring the ORAC-DR display system}

The display is configured via the \texttt{oracdisp} tool and the 
\texttt{disp.dat} file found in ORAC\_DATA\_OUT. The \texttt{oracdisp}
tool provides a graphical front-end to the display system and
can be used to control where images are displayed, what type of display
is used and how the data should be displayed. \texttt{oracdisp}
runs independently of the pipeline, the only interaction between
the pipeline and \texttt{oracdisp} is via a configuration file.
Each time a primitive requests that a data file should be displayed
the pipeline compares the graphics ID generated by the frame itself (usually
the last suffix) with the list of suffixes stored in the display configuration 
file. If they match, the configuration file is read (including information
such as where to display it, the type of device and the bounds) and the
corresponding display engine is instructed to display the data file 
using the supplied option. If multiple matches are made, then multiple
display requests are processed. In this way a single display request
from a primitive can be used to display multiple images (e.g.\ load an image
into \gaia\ and display a slice using \Kappa).


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sun231_disp.eps}
\caption{The ORACDISP display configuration tool.}
\label{fig:oracdisp}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{oracdisp} tool is shown in figure \ref{fig:oracdisp}. The
tool is split into 3 major sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item A set of 'pages' corresponding to each display type. This is where 
the display details can be modified or details.
\item A lower window containing the current display
definition. Double-clicking on any line will select the entry and load the
information into the top frame. This can be used to copy an entry (e.g.\ 
by modifying the page details and pressing the 'Add' button) or 
modify the existing entry (pressing the 'Modify' button will change the 
highlighted entry - note that choosing a new page will reset the 
selection). A single click on an entry will select it for deletion (see next item).

\item  The lower frame contains buttons for saving and modifying the
definition visible in the lower selection frame. The buttons do the following:
\begin{description}
\item[Configure:] This writes the current definition to disk (in
ORAC\_DATA\_OUT/disp.dat). No backup is made of the original file.
\item[DeleteAll:] Delete all entries in the selection frame
\item[DeleteSelection:] Delete all selected entries (entries are selected by a
single click - they are then highlighted in blue).
\item[Undo:] Undo a deletion
\item[ClearSelection:] Clear all selections.

\end{description}
\end{itemize}

The string that should be placed in the 'File Suffix' entry
widget is discussed in the next section.

\subsection{Displaying frame output}

For SCUBA data, the products of early stages of data reduction
(e.g.\ flatfielding or despiking) are not really suitable for display
so many of the early primitives do not contain display directives.

Table \ref{tab:framegui_id} lists the suffices along with the primitives that
generate the display request (and therefore must be called in the recipe).

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Suffix & Type of image &Primitives \\ \hline
noise&Noise & \_REDUCE\_NOISE\_  \\
sdip &Skydip & \_DISPLAY\_SKYDIP\_ \\
reb  &Rebinned image & \_REBIN\_FRAME\_ \\
pol  &Polarisation (I,P,THETA) image & \_CALCULATE\_POLARISATION\_FRAME\_ \\
p    &Polarisation P image & \_CALCULATE\_POLARISATION\_FRAME\_ \\
theta&Polarisation THETA image& \_CALCULATE\_POLARISATION\_FRAME\_ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Suffix values used to display individual frames}
\label{tab:framegui_id}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Each of these suffixes can be prefixed by an 'sN' prefix where 's' stands for
sub-instrument and N is a number indicating the position of the sub-instrument 
in the raw data (for SCUBA N is usefully between 1 and 3). For example,
a display definition to display both the long and short rebinned images
should contain definitions identified by 's1reb' and 's2reb' whereas
'reb' would be relevant if only 1 sub-instrument is being processed.

\subsection{Displaying group output}


Table \ref{tab:groupgui_id} lists the group suffixes recognised by the
display system.
In a similar way to frame definitions, all group id's are prefixed
by 'gN' where 'g' indicates that a group is being displayed
and 'N' is the sub-instrument number. Unlike for frames, the
gN prefix is always attached regardless of the number of sub-instruments
in the group.

The \_REBIN\_EM2\_GROUP\_ primitive uses a gNpa-thr where 'pa' refers
to the position angle of the chopped data and 'thr' to the chop throw.
For example, to view the rebinned image of the data taken with
65 arcsec chop at 90 degrees position angle for the first sub-instrument
a display id of 'g190-65' would be required.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Suffix & Type of image &Primitives \\ \hline
gNreb  &Rebinned image & \_REBIN\_GROUP\_ \& \_REBIN\_EM2\_GROUP\_ \\
gNpa-thr & Rebinned dual-beam image & \_REBIN\_EM2\_GROUP\_ \\
gNpht & Photometry results & \_DISPLAY\_PHOTOM\_GROUP\_ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Suffix values used to display individual groups.}
\label{tab:groupgui_id}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\appendix

\section{Prerequisites\xlabel{prerequisites}}

The SCUBA \oracdr\ system requires the following Starlink packages
in addition to those packages required to simply run the 
pipeline itself for a generic instrument:

\begin{itemize}
\item \SURF
\item \Kappa
\end{itemize}

For polarimetry data reduction these additional packages are
required:

\begin{itemize}
\item \xref{\textsc{polpack}}{sun223}{}
\item \xref{\textsc{ccdpack}}{sun139}{}
\item \xref{\textsc{cursa}}{sun190}{}
\end{itemize}


\section{Configuring the ORAC-DR environment\xlabel{configuring_the_orac_dr_environment}}

\oracdr\ uses environment variables to configure the global behaviour
of the data reduction pipeline. Environment variables specify the input
and output directories, the instrument type and the recipe/primitive
locations. In general these variables are set by the start up script.

The following variables are used by the pipeline:


\begin{description}
\item[ORAC\_DIR] \mbox{}

This is the location of the \oracdr\ software. At the JAC this will be
\verb|/jcmt_sw/oracdr|. This variable is set as part of the Starlink
login.

\item[ORAC\_PERL5LIB] \mbox{}

This is the location of the ORAC perl libraries. It should be set to
\verb|${ORAC_DIR}/lib/perl5|   %$
This variable is set as part of the Starlink login.

\item[ORAC\_INSTRUMENT] \mbox{}

This environment variable is used to inform \oracdr\ of the instrument
that is to be used by the pipeline. This configures the primitive and recipe
directories, file-naming conventions and other instrument specific
options. In order to process SCUBA data this environment variable should
be set to `SCUBA'. This is set by the \texttt{oracdr\_scuba} command.

\item[ORAC\_DATA\_CAL] \mbox{}

This variable should point to the directory containing the calibration
information. In SCUBA's case these are the files that determine the rules 
that should be used for choosing skydip taus or gains. 
This is set by the \texttt{oracdr\_scuba} command.
At JAC this should be set to \verb|/jcmt_sw/oracdr_cal/|.

\item[ORAC\_DATA\_IN] \mbox{}

This is the directory containing the raw data files. It is equivalent
to the DATADIR environment variable used by the \SURF\ software. 
Currently \oracdr\ must use raw data -- partially processed data can not
be pipelined. At the telescope this is usually set to
\verb|/jcmtarchive/YYYYMMDD/|. The \SURF\ command \scusetenv\
can be used to set this variable automatically (with no argument
the current UT is assumed; an argument is assumed to be the requested
UT date). This is set by the \texttt{oracdr\_scuba} command.

\item[ORAC\_DATA\_OUT] \mbox{}

This is the directory used for writing output data. Data files are
written to this directory rather than to the current directory.
Reduced groups are stored in files of the form
\verb|YYYYMMDD_grp_NNNN_sub.sdf| where \textit{NNNN} is the observation
number and \textit{sub} is the sub-instrument name (e.g.\ long, short\ldots)
This directory will contain the display definition file (\verb|disp.dat|)
and the skydip and gain index files. The \texttt{oracdr\_scuba}
command sets this value to the current directory. This directory
should be on a local disk if at all possible.

\end{description}


\section{Running the pipeline at the JCMT\xlabel{running_the_pipeline_at_the_jcmt}}

Running the pipeline at the JCMT is slightly different to running the pipeline
off-line in Hilo or at another institution.  The \texttt{oracdr\_scuba} command
should be used with no arguments.  In this case the data are arriving now file
by file so that the \texttt{-loop wait} option should be used so pipeline will
wait for new observation files to appear. This is the default if the pipeline
is run without any observation numbers or loop specifiers.  In order to
restart the pipeline from a later observation, the combination of
\texttt{-from NN -loop wait} is required.

Additionally, the fastest machine should be used for the reduction
with a local disk. Ask your support scientist for more information
on this -- it is planned that the \texttt{oracdr\_scuba} command
will automatically locate the correct data disk and inform you
of the optimal data reduction computer.
