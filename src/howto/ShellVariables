Shell Variables - an ORAC-DR HOWTO

=head2 Description

This document describes the complete list of environment variables
used by the pipeline.

=head1 Complete variable list

ORAC-DR uses a number of environment variables for configuration.

=head2 User variables

Users may need to change the following variables before using the
software. 

=over 4

=item C<ORAC_DATA_ROOT>

Location of the raw and reduced data directories if it confirms with
the naming convention for the instrument. Should be set before the
instrument startup script, which uses this variable to set
C<ORAC_DATA_IN> and C<ORAC_DATA_OUT>.

=item C<ORAC_DATA_IN>

Actual location of raw data files. Should be set after the instrument
startup script. 

=item C<ORAC_DATA_OUT>

Actual location of reduced data files. This is also the working
directory of the pipeline. Should be set after the instrument startup
script.

=item C<ORAC_CAL_ROOT>

Directory where the instrument specific 

=item C<ORAC_DATA_CAL>

Location of the calibration files for the instrument. Set by the
instrument startup script to C<ORAC_CAL_ROOT/E<lt>instrumentE<gt>>.

=item C<ORAC_RECIPE_DIR>

Location of user-defined recipes. These supersede any identically
names ones in C<ORAC_DIR/recipes/E<lt>instrumentE<gt>>.


=item C<ORAC_PRIMITIVE_DIR>

Location of user-defined primitives. These supersede any identically
names ones in C<ORAC_DIR/primitives/E<lt>instrumentE<gt>>.

normal circumstances because they are correctly set by their user
logins. They are included here for reference only.

C<ORAC_DIR/lib/perl5>.
