File Suffices for imaging files - an ORAC-DR HOWTO

=head2 Description

Files generated during imaging data reduction have suffices denoting the
processing step that created them. This note contains a list with
short descriptions of what they mean.

=head2 Frame suffices

 Suffix  Stands for              Description

 _bp     Bad Pixel               Co-added with the bad-pixel mask
 _cl     CLone                   Modifiable copy of IRCAM raw data
 _db     De-Biassed              The bias is actually zero, but it sets
				 up various CCDPACK things for later
				 processing
 _dg     De-Glitched             Bad pixels replaced by median of neighbours
 _dk     DarK                    Dark subtracted
 _ess    E-beam Sky Subtracted   Polarimetry target e-beam after sky subtraction
 _ff     Flat Field              Divided by the flat field
 _md     Masked Deviants         Deviant pixels from the neighbourhood
                                 (usually 3 sigma in 15x15) flagged as bad
 _nl     Non-Linearity           The standard non-linearity correction has
                                 been applied (IRCAM only)
 _nm     Normalised to Mode      Normalised masked frames combined to make
                                 the flat field
 _om     Objects Masked          This has sources masked with bad values
                                 so that they do not bias the self flat 
				 field
 _oss    O-beam Sky Subtracted   Polarimetry target o-beam after sky subtraction
 _qm     Quadrant Masked         One of the quadrants is masked with bad
                                 pixels, created in QUADRANT_JITTER
 _sbp    Substitute Bad Pixels   Bad pixels replaced (needed for PISA)
 _sc     SCaled                  Data scaled to lie within the range of 
				 values allowed by PISA for the object 
				 masking
 _ss     Sky Subtracted          Global or local sky subtraction applied
 _th     THresholded             Non-physical values in dark-subtracted
                                 frame set to bad
 _trn    TRaNsform               The transformed/resampled data immediately 
 				 prior to making a mosaic


=head2 Group suffices

 Suffix  Stands for              Description

 _I       Intensity              Polarisation intensity 
 _mos     Mosaic                 Final mosaic                    
 _mu      Mosaic (Unfiltered)    Intermediate mosaic (could contain
                                 bad/hot pixels)
 _P       Percentage             Percentage polarisation 
 _PI      Polarisation Intensity 
 _Q       Stokes Q               Stokes Q parameter 
 _sp      Stokes Parameters      Data cube of Stokes parameters 
 _TH      THeta                  Polarisation angle 
 _U       Stokes U               Stokes U parameter
