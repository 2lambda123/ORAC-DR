=head1 File Suffices for UFTI files - an ORAC-DR HOWTO

=head2 Description

Files generated during UFTI data reduction have suffices denoting the
processing step that created them. This note contains a list with
short descriptions of what they mean.

=head2 UFTI suffices

 Suffix  Stands for             Description

 _bp     Bad Pixel              Co-added with the bad-pixel mask
 _cl     CLone                  Modifiable copy of IRCAM raw data
 _db     De-Biassed             The bias is actually zero, but it sets
				up various CCDPACK things for later
				processing
 _dg     De-Glitched            Bad pixels replaced by median of neighbours
 _dk     DarK                   Dark subtracted
 _ff     Flat Field             Divided by the flat field
 _md     Masked Deviants        Deviant pixels from the neighbourhood
                                (usually 3 sigma in 15x15) flagged as bad
 _nl     Non-Linearity          The standard non-linearity correction has
                                been applied
 _nm     Normalised to Mode     Created in QUADRANT_JITTER to normalise
                                frames combined to make the flat field
 _om     Objects Masked         This has sources masked with bad values
                                so that they do not bias the self flat 
				field
 _qm     Quadrant Masked        One of the quadrants is masked with bad
                                pixels, created in QUADRANT_JITTER
 _sbp    Substitute Bad Pixels  Bad pixels replaced (needed for PISA)
 _sc     SCaled                 Data scaled to lie within the range of 
				values allowed by PISA for the object 
				masking
 _ss     Sky Subtracted         Global or local sky subtraction applied
 _trn    TRaNsform              The transformed/resampled data immediately 
 				prior to making a mosaic
