Gillian Wright (UKATC) and Andy Adamson (JAC).

Software support for SCUBA was added by Tim Jenness.  Malcolm Currie
provided the software for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle imaging.  Support
for CGS4 and Michelle spectroscopy was added by Paul Hirst, Frossie
Economou, Tim Jenness, Malcolm Currie, and Brad Cavanagh.  The ORAC-DR
GUI was added by Alasdair Allan (Starlink). IRIS-2 support was added
by Brad Cavanagh in conjunction with Stuart Ryder (AAT). ISAAC and
INGRID support was added by Malcolm Currie. UIST IFU support was added
by Stephen Todd.

The developers are also grateful to numerous members of UKIRT and JCMT
staff for their ideas and feedback.
