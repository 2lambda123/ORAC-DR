File Suffices for spectroscopy files - an ORAC-DR HOWTO

=head2 Description

Files generated during spectroscopy data reduction have suffices
denoting the processing step that created them. This note contains a
list with short descriptions of what they mean.

=head2 Frame suffices

 Suffix  Stands for              Description

 _mraw   Modifiable RAW data     Modifiable copy of the raw data
 _bp     Bad Pixels              Has known bad pixels marked as such
 _rnv    Read Noise Variance     Has a variance array added that represents the array readnoise
 _sbf    Subtracted Bias frame   Has had a BIAS frame subtracted
 _acb    Added Chop Beams        The sum of the chop beams (used for flats)
 _scb    Subtracted Chop Beams   The difference of the chop beams.
 _pov    Poisson Noise Variance  Has had Poisson Variance added the the Variance Array
 _bgl    BackGround Limit	 Tells you how background limited the integration was
 _ipm    Interleave Prepared     Fully prepared for interleaving
         and Masked
 _inc    INterleave Coadd        Samples have been interleaved and Coadded
 _ff     Flat Fielded            Had been divided by a flat field
 _wce    Wavelength Calibrated   Has an estimated (from the headers) wavelength scale applied
         by Estimation
 _ss     Sky Subtracted          Sky Subtracted.
 _bpd    Bad pixels Detected     Has pixels detected as such marked as bad
 _bpm    Bad pixel Mask          a _bpd frame made into a mask.
 _bco    Bias COadded            Co-addition of the integrations in a bias frame.
 _nf     Normalised Flat         A flat field frame normalised to unity.

 _rif    RIpple Flat                 The "Ripple flat" that will be used for derippling
 _dri    DeRIppled                   The De-rippled Spectra
 _ccs    Cross-Correlated & Shifted  The other beams have been aligned to beam 1
 _ccf    Cross-Correlation Function  The CCF used to form the _ccs files
 _sp     SPectrum                    All the extracted spectra coadded.
 _aws    Aligned With Standard       Object spectrum shifted to align with it's standard star
 _scf    Standard CCF                The CCF used to form the _aws files. 
 _dbs    Divided By Standard         Divided by Standard
