Making a Starlink release
-------------------------

The following steps are required to make a starlink release
of ORAC-DR

1. Update the version number in starlink/makefile

2. Update the starlink/oracdr.news file (if necessary)

3. create a directory and change into it

4. Checkout the oracdr code

   cvs export -r HEAD oracdr

   [this assumes CVS is up to date]


     - remove any instruments from oracdr/recipes and oracdr/primitives
       that are not ready for release

     - move the oracdr/starlink/mk, makefile and oracdr.news files
       to the main directory (the one that you created in 3)

     - move the SUN documentation and figures to the main directory
       and copy in the .htx_tar files.

     - move ORAC-DR_CONDITIONS into the main directory

     - remove the oracdr/starlink, /docs, /t and /uml directories

     - Might need to add 'use NDF' to the top of the oracdr and
       xoracdr perl programs so that the will load correctly on 
       Alpha (there used to be a problem with the overriding of
       the getarg function).

4b Run the oracdr/admin/nongeneric_imaging.csh (remembering to 
set ORAC_DIR)

5. Copy JCMT::Tau and related modules into oracdr/lib/perl5/ so 
   that the SCUBA recipes work

5b. We need Astro::Telescope to be copied into oracdr/lib/perl5
    since that was not included in Starlink perlmods.

6. Create tar of oracdr source tree in oracdr_source.tar in the
working directory

   tar cvf oracdr_source.tar oracdr

7. Checkout the calibration system

   cvs export -r HEAD oracdr_cal

8. Rename it 'cal'

   mv oracdr_cal cal

9. Remove unneeded instruments

10. Tar up the calibration system

   tar cvf oracdr_cal.tar cal

11. Make a Starlink distribution

   setenv SYSTEM ix86_Linux (or whatever)
   ./mk export_source

source code appears in oracdr.tar.gz.


Finally tag the release with the appropriate tag
