=head1 NAME

_DELETE_TEMP_FILES_GROUP_ - delete temporary files for all Frames in current Group

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_DELETE_TEMP_FILES_GROUP_ OBSEND=1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive operates on Groups, looping over all the Frame objects
in the current Group and deleting the temporary files associated with
that Frame. The global Frm variable is set to the current Frame object
to enable the C<_DELETE_TEMP_FILES_> primitive to work.

The user may specify whether or not the pipeline should wait until the
observation has ended before proceeding.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<KEEP>

A comma-separated list of file suffices for files which are not to be
deleted. This list is passed directly to C<_DELETE_TEMP_FILES_>. See
the documentation for C<_DELETE_TEMP_FILES_> for further details.

=item B<OBSEND>

A flag to denote whether to wait until the observation has finished
before deleting temporary files. Default is 1 (wait).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_DELETE_TEMP_FILES_

=back

=head1 NOTES

This primitive relies on the C<OBSEND> flag existing in the
user-header of the current Frame. It does not check the FITS entry
directly.

This primitive should not be confused with
C<_DELETE_TEMP_GROUP_FILES_> which allows the user to specify
particular files to delete.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

On exit the current Frame object will be equal to the last Frame in
the Group which may not be the same as on entry. However, this should
not matter as this primitive will likely be the last in a recipe.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.
