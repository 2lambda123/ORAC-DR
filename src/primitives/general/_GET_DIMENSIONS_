=head1 NAME

_GET_DIMENSIONS_ - Retrieve a frame's dimensions.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive returns the upper and lower bounds for a given frame.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item DIMS = ARRAY REFERENCE (Returned)

A reference to an array of the lengths of the dimensions of the
object.

=item FILE = STRING (Given)

The name of the file to retrieve the dimensions for. If not defined,
then defer to the GROUP parameter. If defined, over-ride the GROUP
parameter. ['']

=item FLBOUND = ARRAY REFERENCE (Returned)

A reference to an array of the lower bounds of the object in the
current WCS frame.

=item FUBOUND = ARRAY REFERENCE (Returned)

A reference to an array of the upper bounds of the object in the
current WCS frame.

=item GROUP = LOGICAL (Given)

If true, then the dimensions of the current Group object will be
returned. Otherwise, the dimensions of the current Frame object will
be returned. [0]

=item LBOUND = ARRAY REFERENCE (Returned)

A reference to an array of the lower bounds of the object.

=item UBOUND = ARRAY REFERENCE (Returned)

A reference to an array of the upper bounds of the object.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The arrays returned by reference in the DIMS, LBOUND, and UBOUND
parameters will have as many members as there are dimensions in the
input object.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 TASKS

KAPPA: NDFTRACE.

=head1 REQUIRED PERL MODULES

None.
