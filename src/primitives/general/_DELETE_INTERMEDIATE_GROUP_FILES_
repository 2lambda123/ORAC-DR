# Name:
#    DELETE_INTERMEDIATE_GROUP_FILES
#
# Purpose:
#    Removes intermediate group frames.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This is a generic primitive to handle end of recipe tidy up of
#    intermediate group files.
#
# Notes:
#    In some cases the group file (or mosaic) may have subsequent
#    processing steps.  This script is intended to remove the intermediate
#    files thereby created.  Some care must be taken to remove the files
#    at the correct time.  The recommended approach is to use steering
#    intermediate group files (i.e. ones with g prefix).
#
#    If the environment variable ORAC_KEEP is set, no files will be
#    deleted.
#
# Arguments:
#    DELETE = CHARACTER (Read)
#       Comma-separated list of suffices for files that are to be deleted.
#       If DELETE is not supplied, no files are removed.
#
# Examples:
#    _DELETE_INTERMEDIATE_GROUP_FILES_ DELETE=_ypr,_cpc
#        This would erase all group files ending in _ypr and _cpc associated
#        with the current group file.
#
# Prior Requirements:
#    The Grp->file should be defined and refer to the desired group.

=head1 NAME

_DELETE_INTERMEDIATE_GROUP_FILES_ -- Removes intermediate group frames.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a generic primitive to handle end of recipe tidy up of
intermediate group files.

=head1 NOTES

In some cases the GROUP primitives require certain intermediate files
to be available in order for the recipe to proceed (e.g. recipes
involving the re-calculation of flatfields will want to retain the
pre-flatfielded data on disk so that the flatfielded images can be
regenerated).  This script is intended to be used for their removal.
This means that some care must be taken to remove the files at the
correct time.  The recommended approach is to use steering information
associated with a recipe in a E<lt>recipeE<gt>_TIDY primitive.

If the environment variable ORAC_KEEP is set, no files will be
deleted.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item DELETE = CHARACTER (Read)

Comma-separated list of suffices for files that are to be deleted.
If DELETE is not supplied, no files are removed.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item _DELETE_INTERMEDIATE_GROUP_FILES_ DELETE=_ypr,_cpc

This would erase all group files ending in _ypr and _cpc associated
with the current group file.

=back

=head1 PRIOR REQUIREMENTS

The Grp->file should be defined and refer to the desired group.
