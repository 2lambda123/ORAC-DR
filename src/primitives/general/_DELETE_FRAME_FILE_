=head1 NAME

_DELETE_FRAME_FILE_ -- Remove the frame files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generic primitive to remove the actual frame file.

=head1 NOTES

In rare cases you do not care about the Frame data product (maybe
because the group product is the only product of interest) and do
not want it to remain on disk. This primitive will erase the current
frame file.
