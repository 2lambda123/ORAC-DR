# Name:
#    DELETE_A_FRAME
#
# Purpose:
#    Deletes a frame, usually one not stored in a $Frm.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Generic primitive to delete the odd frame, not stored in a $Frm.
#    It insulates the primitives from the file format and hence the
#    extension name.
#
# Notes:
#    If the environment variable ORAC_KEEP is set, no files will
#    be deleted.
#
# Arguments:
#    FRAME = CHARACTER (Read)
#       Comma-separated list of frames that are to be deleted.
#       If FRAME is not supplied, no files are removed.
#
# Examples:
#    _DELETE_A_FRAME_ FRAME=tempmosaic
#       This would erase the tempmosaic frame.
