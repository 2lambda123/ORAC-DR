# Name:
#    _POL_JITTER_TIDY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Removes unwanted intermediate files for the POL_JITTER recipe
#    and its variants.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _ff suffix.
#    Mosaics, and polarisation and intensity frames are also retained.
#    Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided
#    by the steering headers REGISTER_IMAGES, MAKE_MOSAIC, and CYCLE_NUMBER.
#    Registration text files with extensions .find, .off, and .res are also
#    removed.
