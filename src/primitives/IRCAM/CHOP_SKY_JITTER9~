# CHOP_SKY_JITTER9

# Name:
#    CHOP_SKY_JITTER9

# Purpose:
#    Reduction of alternating sky-target jitters using interpolated sky subtraction.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description: 
#    This recipe reduces a moderately extended source using UFTI data.  The
#    data comprise alternating blank-sky and target frames commencing and
#    ending with a blank sky.  Both the sky and target frames are jittered.
#    The recipe makes a sky-subtracted untrimmed mosaic automatically.

#    The script performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field division, sky subtraction, registration,
#    resampling, and mosaicking.  The notes give more details.

#    It is suitable for extended objects where the object fills or nearly
#    fills the frame, so sky estimation within the frame is impossible or
#    unreliable, but the extended mapping of the target is not required.

# Notes: 
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  The flat field is derived from the sky frames as follows.  The
#    mode (sigma-clipped mean) is used to offset each sky frame's mode
#    to that of the first sky frame.  The corrected sky frames are
#    combined pixel by pixel using a median of the values in each
#    frame.  The resultant frame is normalised by its median to form
#    the flat field.  This frame median is subtracted from the source
#    frames after they have been flat-fielded.  A flat field is created
#    from all the jittered sky frames, and applied to all the target
#    frames.
#    -  The sky subtraction comes from linear interpolation of the sky
#    modal values of the two sky frames which immediately bracket the
#    target frame.
#    -  Registration is performed using common point sources in the
#    overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
#    objects, it then tries the crosshead offsets.  If these are null,
#    the script resorts to the telescope offsets.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The noise will be greater in the mosaic's peripheral areas, having
#    received less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
#    exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  At the end of each cycle of 19 frames the full mosaic of nine target 
#    frames is created and displayed.  The mosaic has its bad pixels
#    filled by interpolation.  On the second and subsequent cycles the
#    full mosaic is added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
#    noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass header, AMEND, is updated to
#    match that of the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in g<date>_<group_number>_mos.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of nine target frames in
#    g<date>_<group_number>_mos_<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in f<date>_<obs_number>_ff.
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<group_number>subgrp for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<group_number>subgrp_<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of target frames in the jitter pattern. [9]

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK
#    KAPPA, and PISA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.

CHOP_SKY_JITTER9 -- Reduction of alternating sky-target jitters using interpolated sky subtraction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION 

This recipe reduces a moderately extended source using UFTI data.  The
data comprise alternating blank-sky and target frames commencing and
ending with a blank sky.  Both the sky and target frames are jittered.
The recipe makes a sky-subtracted untrimmed mosaic automatically.

The script performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
subtraction, flat-field division, sky subtraction, registration,
resampling, and mosaicking.  The notes give more details.

It is suitable for extended objects where the object fills or nearly
fills the frame, so sky estimation within the frame is impossible or
unreliable, but the extended mapping of the target is not required.

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

The flat field is derived from the sky frames as follows.  The
mode (sigma-clipped mean) is used to offset each sky frame's mode
to that of the first sky frame.  The corrected sky frames are
combined pixel by pixel using a median of the values in each
frame.  The resultant frame is normalised by its median to form
the flat field.  This frame median is subtracted from the source
frames after they have been flat-fielded.  A flat field is created
from all the jittered sky frames, and applied to all the target
frames.

=item *

The sky subtraction comes from linear interpolation of the sky
modal values of the two sky frames which immediately bracket the
target frame.

=item *

Registration is performed using common point sources in the
overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
objects, it matches the centroid of the central source.  If this
fails, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
transformed to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The noise will be greater in the mosaic's peripheral areas, having
received less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

At the end of each cycle of 19 frames the full mosaic of nine target 
frames is created and displayed.  The mosaic has its bad pixels
filled by interpolation.  On the second and subsequent cycles the
full mosaic is added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass header, AMEND, is updated to
match that of the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames.
