# Name:
#    _JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR
#    recipes through steering headers listed below.  It forms a subgroup
#    by filter name, stored by reference in the $Grp internal headers
#    as <filter>_GROUP for later efficient access.  Each subgrp has its
#    own file name giving by the $Grp filename followed by "_<filter>".
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    DO_APHOT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not perform aperture photometry.  Photometry is
#       performed once the mosaic is made.
#    JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter.
#    MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to make the flat.  The flat is made once all the
#       jittered target frames in a cycle are available.
#    MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not register the frames and make the mosaic.  The mosaic
#       is made once all the jittered target frames in a cycle are available.
#    MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
#       jittered frames in a cycle are available.
#    REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL
#       A true value specifies the reference frame for normalisation
#       of the masked frames.  It is true for the first frame
#       and false for all subsequent frames in the observation.
#    TARGET_OR_SKY = CHARACTER
#       This is "target" for a target frame, and "sky" for a sky calibration
#       frame.  All frames should be target.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of frames in the jitter.  The minimum is 3. [9]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  If the subgroup already exists, its file name is used for the
#    its replacement sub-group.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive control processing for JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipes through
recipes through steering headers listed below.  It forms a subgroup
by filter name, stored by reference in the $Grp internal headers
as E<lt>filterE<gt>_GROUP for later efficient access.  Each subgrp has its
own file name giving by the $Grp filename followed by "_E<lt>filterE<gt>".

Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.

Whether or not perform aperture photometry.
Photometry is performed once the mosaic is made.

=item JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER

=item MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL

Whether or not to make the flat.  The flat is made once all the
jittered target frames in a cycle are available.

=item MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL

Whether or not register the frames and make the mosaic.  The mosaic

=item MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL

Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
jittered frames in a cycle are available.

=item REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL

A true value specifies the reference frame for normalisation
of the masked frames.  It is true for the first frame
and false for all subsequent frames in the observation.

=item TARGET_OR_SKY = CHARACTER

This is "target" for a target frame, and "sky" for a sky calibration
frame.  All frames should be target.
