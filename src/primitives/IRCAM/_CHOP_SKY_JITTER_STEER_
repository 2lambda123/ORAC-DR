# Name:
#    _CHOP_SKY_JITTER_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipes through
#    steering headers listed below.  It also reports whether each frame is
#    of the target or of some sky background.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter.
#    MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to make the flat.  A flat is made once all the
#       frames and the bracketing sky are available.
#    MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not register the frames and make the full mosaic.
#       The grand mosaic is made once all the frames in a cycle are
#       available.
#    REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL
#       A true value specifies the reference sky frame to which all
#       subsequent skies are normalised.  It is true for the first frame
#       and false for all subsequent frames in the observation.
#    SUBTRACT_SKY = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not it is time to subtract the sky.  Sky subtraction
#       occurs once all the frames in a cycle are available.
#    TARGET_OR_SKY = CHARACTER
#       This is "target" for a target frame, and "sky" for a sky calibration
#       frame.  The target and sky alternate for these recipes.
#    TARGET_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       When TARGET_OR_SKY is "target", this counts the target frames,
#       starting from zero.  It is used for interpolation between sky
#       measurements.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of target frames in the target jitter.  It's the n
#       in CHOP_SKY_JITTERn.  The minimum is 3 because this number of
#       blank skies are needed to form a flat field. [9]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.

_CHOP_SKY_JITTER_STEER_ -- Steers processing for CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive control processing for CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipes through
steering headers listed below.  It also reports whether each frame is
of the target or of some sky background.

=head1 STEERING HEADERS

=over 4

=item CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER

Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.

=item JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER

The number of frames in the jitter.

=item MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL

Whether or not to make the flat.  A flat is made once all the
frames and the bracketing sky are available.

=item MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL

Whether or not register the frames and make the full mosaic.
The grand mosaic is made once all the frames in a cycle are
available.

=item REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL

A true value specifies the reference sky frame to which all
subsequent skies are normalised.  It is true for the first frame
and false for all subsequent frames in the observation.

=item SUBTRACT_SKY = LOGICAL

Whether or not it is time to subtract the sky.  Sky subtraction
occurs once all the frames in a cycle are available.

=item TARGET_OR_SKY = CHARACTER

This is "target" for a target frame, and "sky" for a sky calibration
frame.  The target and sky alternate for these recipes.

=item TARGET_NUMBER = INTEGER

When TARGET_OR_SKY is "target", this counts the target frames,
starting from zero.  It is used for interpolation between sky
measurements.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)

The number of target frames in the target jitter.  It's the I<n>
in CHOP_SKY_JITTERI<n>.  The minimum is 3 because this number of
blank skies are needed to form a flat field. [9]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
