# Name:
#    _SUBTRACT_SKY_SKY_AND_JITTER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Subtracts a sky frame for SKY_AND_JITTER recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive subtracts from the current frame the most-recent and
#    matching sky frame given by $Cal->sky method.  It reports
#    a successful sky subtraction and the frames concerned.  It is a
#    variant of _SUBTRACT_SKY_ for SKY_AND_JITTER recipes.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object frames, and when the
#    steering header SUBTRACT_SKY is true.
#    -  The sky-subtracted image can be displayed.
#    -  The subtraction assumes the same exposure time for the sky and
#    object frame.  That validation should be done by the $Cal->sky
#    method.
#    -  The frame title is propagated.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Sky-subtracted frame inheriting the frame's name but with the
#    _ss suffix.
#
# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: CALCOR.

SUBTRACT_SKY_SKY_AND_JITTER -- Subtracts a sky frame for SKY_AND_JITTER recipes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive subtracts from the current frame the most-recent and
matching sky frame given by $Cal->sky method.  It reports a successful
sky subtraction and the frames concerned.  It is a variant
of _SUBTRACT_SKY_ for SKY_AND_JITTER recipes.

This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object frames, and when the steering header
SUBTRACT_SKY is true.

=item *

The sky-subtracted image can be displayed.

=item *

The subtraction assumes the same exposure time for the sky and
object frame.  That validation should be done by the $Cal->sky method.

=item *

The frame title is propagated.
