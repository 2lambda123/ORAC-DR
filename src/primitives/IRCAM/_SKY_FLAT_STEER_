# Name:
#    _SKY_FLAT_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for SKY_FLAT recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for SKY_FLAT recipes through
#    steering headers listed below.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter.
#    MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to make the flat.  The flat is made once all the
#       jittered target frames in a cycle are available.
#    MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
#       jittered frames in a cycle are available.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of frames in the jitter.  The minimum is 3. [5]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
