# Name:
#    _BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE recipes through
#    steering headers listed below.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    DO_APHOT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not perform aperture photometry.  Photometry occurs
#       after the mosaic is made.
#    JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter.
#    MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not register the frames and make the mosaic.  The mosaic
#       is made once all the jittered frames in a cycle are available.
#    TARGET_OR_SKY = CHARACTER
#       This is "target" for a target frame, and "sky" for a sky calibration
#       frame.  All frames should be target.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of frames in the jitter.  The minimum is 3. [5]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.

Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.

Whether or not perform aperture photometry.  Photometry occurs
after the mosaic is made.
