# Name:
#    _SUBTRACT_DARK_
#
# Purpose:
#    Subtracts a dark frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive subtracts from the current frame the most-recent and
#    matching dark frame given by $Cal->dark method.  It reports
#    a successful dark subtraction and the frames concerned.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  The dark-subtracted image can be displayed.
#    -  The subtraction assumes the same exposure time for the dark and
#    object frame.  That validation should be done by the $Cal->dark
#    method.
#    -  The frame title is propagated.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Dark-subtracted frame inheriting the frame's name but with the
#    _dk suffix.
#
# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: CALCOR.

# This should only be performed on OBJECT frames.

# Generate the input and output filenames.  The output file has the same
# name as the input except the suffix is changed to indicate it has been
# dark subtracted.

       my $dark = $Cal->dark;
       my $header = "in=$in cal=$dark out=$out title=!";

# Note all dark frames and data frames should have the same exposure time.
# This is taken care of by the Cal object.  The absolute exposure times do 
# not matter, only the relative times, which here is one.
