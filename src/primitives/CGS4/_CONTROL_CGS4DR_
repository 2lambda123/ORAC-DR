=head1 NAME

_CONTROL_CGS4DR_ - send a REDUCE command to CGS4DR

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Command CGS4DR/QMAN to reduce the current data. This should be
called after the _EXPORT_CGS4DR_FORMAT_ primitive.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

Creates a new object in C<%Mon> which is attached to a
QMAN monolith. This will fail if QMAN is not running.

=item *

CGS4DR must already be running on the same machine as ORAC-DR.

# Connect to the monolith
# This is made harder by the fact that CGS4DR uses PID-related
# ADAM names
# QMAN is actually named  reverse($pid)_qman
# where $pid is the process ID of the parent CGS4DR_TCL task
# There are two ways to do this:
#   1. Search through the process table until I find CGS4DR_TCL
#       (Can do this with Proc::ProcessTable)
#   2. Search through ADAM_USER (or ~adam) for a pipe named
#      NNNN_qman_NNNN and extract the name from this. This is
#      okay except that we can not guarantee that ADAM_USER is
#      the same now as it was then (in fact $ENV{ADAM_USER} is
#      redefined when running ORAC-DR.

  # We are going to search the PID list

  # We are fine so calculate the name
  # Must be a more efficient way than reverse split???
  my $qman = reverse split (//, $cgs4dr_pid ) .  '_qman';

  # Create the object
