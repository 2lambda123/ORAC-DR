=head1 NAME

_ARRAY_TESTS_ - CGS4 array tests

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the readnoise and dark current parameters for the array.
Also forms bad pixel masks.

This primitive ensures that the BIAS and DARK frames taken as part of
the array tests are also filed with the calibration system so that
they can be used to reduce subsequent data.

The _FIND_BAD_PIXELS_ primitive is called to detect bad pixels at each
stage of the array tests.

The _ARRAY_TESTS_STATISTICS_ primitive is called to determine the
readnoise and dark currents.
