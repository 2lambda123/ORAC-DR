=head1 NAME

_SCUBA2_TIDY_ - delete files created from SCUBA-2 data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_SCUBA2_TIDY_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive deletes files created during processing of SCUBA-2
data. The recipe parameter C<KEEPFILES> is used to determine whether
or not the output files are deleted. It supports the following
recipes:

=over 2

=item B<SCUBA2_DISPLAY_PCA>

If C<KEEPFILES> is +1 then the files with suffices C<_pcacomp>,
C<_pcaamp> and C<_pspec> are kept on disk. The copies made of the raw
data are always deleted.

=item B<SCUBA2_CHECK_CAL>

If C<KEEPFILES> is +1 then the files with suffices C<_crop>,
C<_back> and C<_mf> are kept on disk.

=item B<SCUBA2_CHECK_RMS>

If C<KEEPFILES> is +1 then the files with suffix C<_crop> are kept on
disk.

=back

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<KEEP>

File suffices to keep on disk (e.g., C<_crop>. Default is C<none>.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to display extra information. Default is 1 (yes).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 2

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

general: _DELETE_TEMP_FILES_

=back

=head1 NOTES

This primitive is for use with SCUBA-2 data only.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.
