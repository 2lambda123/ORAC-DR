_SCUBA2_TIDY_ - delete files created from SCUBA-2 data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_SCUBA2_TIDY_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive deletes files created during processing of SCUBA-2
data. The recipe parameter C<KEEPFILES> is used to determine whether
or not the output files are deleted. It supports the following
recipes:

=over 2

=item B<SCUBA2_DISPLAY_PCA>

If C<KEEPFILES> is +1 then the files with suffices C<_pcacomp>,
C<_pcaamp> and C<_pspec> are kept on disk. The copies made of the raw
data are always deleted.

=item B<SCUBA2_FCFNEFD>

If C<KEEPFILES> is +1 then the files with suffices C<_crop>,
C<_back> and C<_mf> are kept on disk.

=back

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The are no arguments.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS
