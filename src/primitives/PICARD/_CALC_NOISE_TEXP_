=head1 NAME

_CALC_NOISE_TEXP_ - calculate the flux of a source

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CALC_NOISE_TEXP_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This PICARD primitive obtains and stores a variety of information
about each image of a calibration source, calculating the mean noise
level and exposure time within a specified aperture.

The default aperture has a radius of 30", though this is overridden by
the presence of the C<APERTURE_RADIUS> recipe parameter.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has no arguments.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR primitives:

SCUBA2: _FIND_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY_, _GET_PIXEL_SCALE_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates files with suffix C<_err> for all images of calibrators which
contain the square-root of the variance component for that image.
