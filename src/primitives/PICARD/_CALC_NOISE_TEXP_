=head1 NAME

_CALC_NOISE_TEXP_ - calculate the mean noise and exposure time in an aperture

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CALC_NOISE_TEXP_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This PICARD primitive calculates the mean noise level and exposure
time within a specified aperture.

The default aperture has a radius of 30", though this is overridden by
the presence of the C<APERTURE_RADIUS> recipe parameter.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has the following arguments:

=over 4

=item B<LOGFILE>

A flag to denote whether to store information in the C<PICARD_RESULTS>
hash for later writing to a logfile. Overridden by the presence of the
C<RECPAR_LOGFILE> recipe parameter. Default is 1.

=item B<RADIUS>

Radius of the aperture used to calculate the mean exposure time and
noise level. Default is 30 arcsec, though overridden by the
C<APERTURE_RADIUS> recipe parameter.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA

NDFCOPY

=item ORAC-DR primitives:

SCUBA2: _FIND_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY_, _CENTROID_IMAGE_;
PICARD: _GET_CURRENT_RESULTS_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates files with suffix C<_err> for all images of calibrators which
contain the square-root of the variance component for that image.
