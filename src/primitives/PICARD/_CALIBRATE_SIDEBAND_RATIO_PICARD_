=head1 NAME

_CALIBRATE_SIDEBAND_RATIO_ - Apply RxA3M sideband ratio corrections.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Apply RxA3m sideband ratio correction to an observation. This will
check the current sideband, and by default will apply the standard
JCMT sideband correction. It will first of all undo any previous
sideband correction applied which wrote its value into the SDBDCORR
FITS header. The output files have a suffix of C<_cal>.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following recipe parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<SIDEBAND>

The sideband to apply the correction for. If not given, the current
system sideband will be used.

Creates an output file for each calibrated input file with suffix
