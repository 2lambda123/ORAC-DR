=head1 NAME

_CALC_FLUX_ - calculate the flux of a source

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CALC_FLUX_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This PICARD primitive is designed to calculate fluxes by aperture
photometry from images of SCUBA-2 sources. Results are stored in the
C<PICARD_RESULTS> data.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has the following arguments:

=over 4

=item B<RADIUS>

Radius of the aperture used to calculate the statistics. Default is 30
arcsec, though overridden by the C<APERTURE_RADIUS> recipe parameter.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR primitives:

SCUBA2: _CALC_IMAGE_NOISE_, _FIND_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.
