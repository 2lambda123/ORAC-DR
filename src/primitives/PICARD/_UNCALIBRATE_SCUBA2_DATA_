=head1 NAME

_UNCALIBRATE_SCUBA2_DATA_ - undo default SCUBA-2 calibration

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_UNCALIBRATE_SCUBA2_DATA_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Undo the default calibration of SCUBA-2 data. This primitive checks
the input units and divides by the appropriate default FCF (derived
from the FITS header if possible) to return the data to units of pW.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has no arguments.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA

CDIV, NDFTRACE, SETUNITS

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The Frame is updated to contain the uncalibrated data files and tagged
with C<uncal>.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates output files with the appended suffix C<_uncal>.

=head1 NOTES

Ideally the history should be searched and the exact FCF used, but for
now assume that the default calibration was applied.
