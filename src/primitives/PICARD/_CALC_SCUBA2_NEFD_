=head1 NAME

_CALC_SCUBA2_NEFD_ - derive NEFDs from input images of SCUBA-2 sources

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CALC_SCUBA2_NEFD_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This PICARD primitive is designed to calculate noise equivalent flux
densities (NEFDs) from images of SCUBA-2 sources. The data are
calibrated if necessary either using the default conversion factors in
the pipeline or FCFs derived in a previous primitive (if stored as
C<PICARD_RESULTS> data).

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has one argument:

=over 4

=item B<LOGFILE>

A flag to denote whether to store information in the C<PICARD_RESULTS>
hash for later writing to a logfile. Overridden by the presence of the
C<RECPAR_LOGFILE> recipe parameter. Default is 1.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR primitives:

SCUBA2: _CALCULATE_NEFD_

PICARD: _CALIBRATE_SCUBA2_DATA_

=back

=head1 NOTES

This primitive creates new files on disk if the data require
calibrating.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

FCFs are written to a log file C<log.nefd>. See
L<_ADD_NEFD_LOG_ENTRY_|_ADD_NEFD_LOG_ENTRY_> for details on the format.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

New output files with the suffix C<_cal> will be created if the data
need calibrating.
