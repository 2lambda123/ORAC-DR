=head1 NAME

_WRITE_FCFNEFD_LOGFILE_ - write log file for fcfnefd workflow

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_WRITE_FCFNEFD_LOGFILE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This PICARD primitive writes a simple ORAC-DR log file.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has no arguments.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

None.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates a log file called C<log.fcfnefd>.

=head1 LOGFILE FORMAT

The log file contains the following entries:

=over 4

=item * Input filename

=item * Object name

=item * Wavelength (um)

=item * Flux within an aperture (in pW, default radius is 30 arcsec)

=item * Mean noise in the image derived from apertures of the same size (pW)

=item * Mean exposure time (s)

=item * WVM tau

=item * Airmass

=item * Noise derived from variance (mJy/beam)

=item * Flux conversion factor derived from Gaussian fit to source (Jy/beam/pW)

=item * Flux conversion factor derived using the peak signal from a
Gaussian beam of the measured total flux density (Jy/beam/pW)

=item * Zenith-corrected NEFD (mJy s**0.5)

=item * NEFD at current WVM tau based on value in S2SRO Call for Proposals (mJy s**0.5)

=item * Radius of aperture used for measurements (of not 30 arcsec)
