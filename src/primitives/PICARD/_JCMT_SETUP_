=head1 NAME

_JCMT_SETUP_ - make JCMT infrastructure available to PICARD

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_JCMT_SETUP_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets up a few useful user-header entries for dealing with JCMT data.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has no arguments.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA

NDFTRACE

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_JCMT_VERIFY_PARAMETERS_

=back

=head1 NOTES

None.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The input data are tagged with C<newimage>. If the units are blank, it
is assumed that the input file is a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
image. In this case, an C<snr> product is defined and the data are
tagged with the same.
