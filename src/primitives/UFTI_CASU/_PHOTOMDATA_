=head1 NAME

_PHOTOMDATA_ -- Set up information relating to photometric standards

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes the filter name of interest and returns a reference
to a structure with information on the standards and how to access them.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item FILTER = char (Given)

The filter of interest

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The calling routine must be expecting two variables called $Finfo and $Cinfo.
The former is a reference to a hash with information about how to form the
standard magnitudes for a given filter.  The latter is a reference to a hash
with information on how to access standard star data for that given filter.
