=head1 NAME

_ICSCALE_ -- Calculate zero point and scaling values for a group of files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive cycles through all of the image extensions that exist in the
current file.  For each extension, it cycles through the files in the current
group and calculates the background median for each image. Additive values
are calculated for each image that can be used to bring them all to a common
background median.  Multiplicative values are also calculated that will do
the same job.  These are written to the image headers to CIR_ZERO and 
CIR_SCAL and are intended for use with cir_imcombine.
