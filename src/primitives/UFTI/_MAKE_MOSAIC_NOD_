# Name:
#    _MAKE_MOSAIC_NOD_
#
# Purpose:
#    Forms a mosaic for a NOD differenced-pairs group.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive makes a mosaic from the object frames in the
#    differenced-frame group of a NOD recipe.  It merely calls the
#    standard _MAKE_MOSAIC_NO_BOUND_ primitive using the
#    difference group instead of the current $Grp.
#
# Arguments:
#    FILLBAD = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), replace the bad pixels in the current cycle's
#       mosaic with a smooth function derived from its neighbours. 
#       Otherwise, leave the bad pixels unaltered.  [1]
#    INT_METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The interpolation method.  This is either "linint" for bi-linear
#       interpolation, or "nearest" for nearest neighbour.  The latter
#       takes about half the time.  ["linint"]
#    RESAMPLE = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), resample the current cycle's frames to the same
#       Cartesian co-ordinate system using the method given by argument
#       INT_METHOD.  If false (0), use integer offsets and changes of
#       origin to register the frames.  The latter is many times
#       faster and is recommended for pipeline operation.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs when the steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is
#    true.
#    -  The arguments are merely passed to _MAKE_MOSAIC_NO_BOUND_ and
#    the group mosaic name is restored to that of the current $Grp,
#    not that of the difference group.

# Arguments
# =========

# Test whether or not it is time to make a mosaic.
    my $makemos = $Frm->hdr( "MAKE_MOSAIC" );
    if ( $makemos ) {

# Obtain the value for the interpolation.
       my $intmethod = ( $_MAKE_MOSAIC_NOD_{INT_METHOD} || "linint" );

# Determine whether or not to fill bad pixels.
       my $fillbad = $_MAKE_MOSAIC_NOD_{FILLBAD};
       $fillbad = defined( $fillbad ) ? $fillbad : 1;

# Determine whether or not to resample.
       my $resample = $_MAKE_MOSAIC_NOD_{RESAMPLE};
       $resample = defined( $resample ) ? $resample : 1;

# Make the group of differenced pairs the local version of $Grp within
# the context delimited by the braces.  The mosaic name is the group
# name.  Define outside the context so that it persists when the
# Grp reverts to the main Grp.
       my $mosname;
       {
          my $Grp = $Grp->uhdr( "DIFFERENCE_GROUP" );
          _MAKE_MOSAIC_NO_BOUND_ INT_METHOD=$intmethod FILLBAD=$fillbad RESAMPLE=$resample

# The group name is changed in _MAKE_MOSAIC_NO_BOUND_ to the mosaic
# name.  However, that's only for the difference group, not the main
# Grp.  So save the name outside this group context, and modify the
# file associated with main Grp.
          $mosname = $Grp->file;
       }
       $Grp->file( $mosname );

=head1 NAME

MAKE_MOSAIC_NOD -- Forms a mosaic for a NOD differenced-pairs group.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive makes a mosaic from the object frames in the
differenced-frame group of a NOD recipe.  It merely calls the
standard _MAKE_MOSAIC_NO_BOUND_ primitive using the
difference group instead of the current $Grp.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item FILLBAD = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), replace the bad pixels in the current cycle's
mosaic with a smooth function derived from its neighbours. 
Otherwise, leave the bad pixels unaltered.  [1]

=item INT_METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)

The interpolation method.  This is either "linint" for bi-linear
interpolation, or "nearest" for nearest neighbour.  The latter
takes about half the time.  ["linint"]

=item RESAMPLE = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), resample the current cycle's frames to the same
Cartesian co-ordinate system using the method given by argument
INT_METHOD.  If false (0), use integer offsets and changes of
origin to register the frames.  The latter is many times
faster and is recommended for pipeline operation.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.

=item *

Processing only occurs when the steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is
true.

=item *

The arguments are merely passed to _MAKE_MOSAIC_NO_BOUND_ and
the group mosaic name is restored to that of the current $Grp,
not that of the difference group.
