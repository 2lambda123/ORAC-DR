# Name:
#    _MAKE_MOSAIC_NOD_
#
# Purpose:
#    Forms a mosaic for a NOD differenced-pairs group.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive makes a mosaic from the object frames in the
#    differenced-frame group of a NOD recipe.  It merely calls the
#    standard _MAKE_MOSAIC_ primitive using the difference group
#    instead of the current $Grp.
#
# Arguments:
#    FILLBAD = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), replace the bad pixels in the current cycle's
#       mosaic with a smooth function derived from its neighbours. 
#       Otherwise, leave the bad pixels unaltered.  [1]
#    INT_METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The interpolation method.  This is either "linint" for bi-linear
#       interpolation, or "nearest" for nearest neighbour.  The latter
#       takes about half the time.  ["linint"]
#    RESAMPLE = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), resample the current cycle's frames to the same
#       Cartesian co-ordinate system using the method given by argument
#       INT_METHOD.  If false (0), use integer offsets and changes of
#       origin to register the frames.  The latter is many times
#       faster and is recommended for pipeline operation.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs when the steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is
#    true.
#    -  The arguments are merely passed to _MAKE_MOSAIC_ and the group
#    mosaic name is restored to that of the current $Grp, not that of
#    the difference group.  The updated headers are also propagated
#    back into the current $Grp from the sub-group.

=head1 NAME

_MAKE_MOSAIC_NOD_ -- Forms a mosaic for a NOD differenced-pairs group.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive makes a mosaic from the object frames in the
differenced-frame group of a NOD recipe.  It merely calls the standard
_MAKE_MOSAIC_ primitive using the difference group instead of the
current $Grp.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item FILLBAD = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), replace the bad pixels in the current cycle's
mosaic with a smooth function derived from its neighbours. 
Otherwise, leave the bad pixels unaltered.  [1]

=item INT_METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)

The interpolation method.  This is either "linint" for bi-linear
interpolation, or "nearest" for nearest neighbour.  The latter
takes about half the time.  ["linint"]

=item RESAMPLE = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), resample the current cycle's frames to the same
Cartesian co-ordinate system using the method given by argument
INT_METHOD.  If false (0), use integer offsets and changes of
origin to register the frames.  The latter is many times
faster and is recommended for pipeline operation.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.

=item *

Processing only occurs when the steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is
true.

=item *

The arguments are merely passed to _MAKE_MOSAIC_ and the group mosaic
name is restored to that of the current $Grp, not that of the
difference group.  The updated headers are also propagated back into
the current $Grp from the sub-group.
