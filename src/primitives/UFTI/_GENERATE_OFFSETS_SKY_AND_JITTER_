# _GENERATE_OFFSETS_SKY_AND_JITTER_       -*- perl -*-
#
# Function:
#    Find the offsets between the frames in a SKY_AND_JITTERn recipe.
#
# Primitives Called:
#    _GENERATE_OFFSETS_
#
# Arguments:
#    COMPLETE = REAL (Given)
#       Completeness of matched features for registration between two frames
#       to be accepted.  It must be in the range 0.2 to 1.0. [0.4]
#    MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)
#       Minimum number of contiguous pixels above the PERCENTILE level
#       to be considered a registration feature.  It must be at least 6.
#       [9]
#    PERCENTILE = REAL (Given)
#       Percentile threshold for locating objects to register frames. 
#       It must be in the range 75 to 99.9. [98]

# Selection
# =========

# This should only be performed on OBJECT frames.

# ====================

# Obtain the parameters for the detection.
