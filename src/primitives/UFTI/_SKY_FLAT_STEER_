# Name:
#    _SKY_FLAT_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for SKY_FLAT recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for SKY_FLAT recipes through
#    steering headers listed below.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter.
#    MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to make the flat.  The flat is made once all the
#       jittered target frames in a cycle are available.
#    MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
#       jittered frames in a cycle are available.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of frames in the jitter.  If absent, the number of
#       offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS, minus one is used.  If
#       neither is available, 5 is used.  An error state arises if
#       the number of jittered frames is fewer than 3.  []
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.

# more is missing.

# the recipe requires NOFFSETS-1.

# Set steering headers.
# =====================

# Specify during processing of which frames should the flat be created.
       if ( ($Grp->num + 1) == $number ) {
          $Frm->hdr( "MAKE_FLAT", 1 );

          $Frm->hdr( "MASK_OBJECTS", 0 );

# Insert the cycle number of the set of NUMBER frames.

# Insert the number of frames in the jitter.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive control processing for SKY_FLAT recipes through
steering headers listed below.

=head1 STEERING HEADERS

=over 4

=item CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER

Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.

=item JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER

The number of frames in the jitter.

=item MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL

Whether or not to make the flat.  The flat is made once all the
jittered target frames in a cycle are available.

=item MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL

Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
jittered frames in a cycle are available.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)

The number of frames in the jitter.  If absent, the number of
offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS, minus one is used.  If
neither is available, 9 is used.  An error state arises if
the number of jittered frames is fewer than 3.  []

This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
