# Name:
#    _QUADRANT_JITTER_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for QUADRANT_JITTER recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for QUADRANT_JITTER recipes through
#    steering headers listed below.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to make the flat.  A flat is made once all the
#       frames in a cycle are available.
#    MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not register the frames and make a row mosaic.  A
#       mosaic is made once all the frames in a cycle are available.
#    MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
#       jittered frames in a cycle are available.
#    REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL
#       A true value specifies the reference frame for normalisation
#       of the masked frames.  It is true for the first frame
#       and false for all subsequent frames in the observation.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object frames.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive control processing for QUADRANT_JITTER recipes through
steering headers listed below.

=head1 STEERING HEADERS

=over 4

=item CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER

Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.

=item MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL

Whether or not to make the flat.  A flat is made once all the
frames in a cycle are available.

=item MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL

Whether or not register the frames and make a row mosaic.  A
mosaic is made once all the frames in a cycle are available.

=item MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL

Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
jittered frames in a cycle are available.

=item REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL

A true value specifies the reference frame for normalisation
of the masked frames.  It is true for the first frame
and false for all subsequent frames in the observation.
