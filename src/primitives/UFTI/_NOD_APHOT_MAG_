# Name:
#    _NOD_APHOT_MAG_
#
# Purpose:
#    Performs aperture photometry for NOD recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive computes photometry for the individual frames and
#    mosaic of a NOD jitter.  It invokes _FIXED_APERTURE_PHOTOMETRY_
#    to derive aperture photometry for both the positive and negative
#    point sources.  Photometry is performed for each frame of the
#    current cycle in the difference group, and the group mosaic frame.
#
#  Arguments:
#     APERTURE = REAL (Given)
#        The aperture in arcseconds for the photometry.  [5.0]
#     INNER = REAL (Given)
#        The ratio of the diameters of inner ring of the sky annulus to
#        that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained
#        to be in the range 1.1 to 3.0.  The mode of the pixel values in 
#        the annulus is used to subtract the sky for statistics 3) and
#        4) listed above.  [1.3]
#     SKY_EST = INTEGER (Given)
#        Sky estimations method as per AUTOPHOTOM parameter SKYEST.  The
#        default is the mode, so as to exclude contaminating sources.
#        1 is the mean; 2 is the average of values within two standard
#        deviations of the mean; 3 is the mode from PHOTOM, 4 is a 
#        multiply clipped mean emulating the mode but without involving
#        the median.  It is supplied as a constant to AUTOPHOTOM (hence
#        option 4).  The final option is to cope with self-flat frames
#        with a spike artifact in the histogram thus giving the wrong
#        median, and hence biased mode.  The default is used should 
#        the supplied value not be one of the allowed options. [4]
#     OUTER = REAL (Given)
#        The ratio of the diameters of outer ring of the sky annulus to
#        that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained to
#        be in the range 1.4 to 5.0 and be at least 0.3 greater than the
#        inner scale factor of the annulus.  For UFTI the default is 
#        2.5 and for IRCAM it is 2.0.  []
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    Instrument-specific headers are obtained where appropriate.
#    -  Processing only occurs when it is time to perform photometry,
#    i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true, and only on object
#    frames.
#    -  The steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the recipe cycle
#    number.
#    -  The reference to the difference group is stored in the internal
#    group header DIFFERENCE_GROUP.
#    -  To discriminate between the various results, in the results
#    file the positive images have suffix "_pos" after the frame name
#    and the negative images have a "_neg" suffix.
#    -  The primitive sets the telescope offsets of the mosaic to be zero
#    both in the physical frame and in the group header.  It then finds
#    the displacements of the positive and negative images about the centre
#    of each frame.  The displacements are half of the reference (first)
#    frame's headers XOFFSET_DIFFERENCE and YOFFSET_DIFFERENCE.
