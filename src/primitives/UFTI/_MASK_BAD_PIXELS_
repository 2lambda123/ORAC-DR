# Name:
#    _MASK_BAD_PIXELS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Applies a bad-pixel mask.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive applies the bad-pixel mask to the current frame, 
#    creating a masked frame by adding a pixel mask frame.  The bad
#    [oxe;s are specified by Starlink bad (`magic') values.  The 
#    primitive reports a successful masking and the frames concerned.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  The masked image can be displayed.
#    -  The mask frame is obtained from the $Cal->mask method.
#    -  The frame title is propagated.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Bad-pixel-masked frame inheriting the current frame's name 
#    but with the _bp suffix.

This primitive applies the bad-pixel mask to the current frame, 
creating a masked frame by adding a pixel mask frame.  The bad
[oxe;s are specified by Starlink bad (`magic') values.  The 
primitive reports a successful masking and the frames concerned.
