#    Removes unwanted intermediate files for the NOD_SELF_FLAT recipe

# Description:
#    Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _ff suffix.
#    Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided
#    by the steering headers FLAT_DIVIDE, MAKE_MOSAIC and CYCLE_NUMBER,

# Certain files can only be removed once certain steps are complete,
# and then only as a group.  So determine if it's time to remove these

# the FLAT_DIVIDE steering parameter, as this is activated every cycle.
# Obtain the cycle number too.

# Remove the remaining files from this cycle used to make the flat.

# Remove the remaining files from this cycle used to make the mosaic.
# Note these are in the difference-pair group.

# differenced pairs.  Then use the standard primitive which expects
