# Name:
#    _JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR_TIDY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Removes unwanted intermediate files for the JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR
#    recipe and its variants.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _ff suffix.
#    Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided
#    by the steering headers MAKE_FLAT, MAKE_MOSAIC, and CYCLE_NUMBER.
#    Group tidying only applies to the sub-group matching the current
#    frame's filter and cycle number.  Registration text files with
#    extensions .find, .off, and .res are also removed.

=head1 NAME

_JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR_TIDY_ -- Removes unwanted intermediate files for the JITTER_SELF_FLAT recipe and its variant.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _ff suffix.
Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided by
the steering headers MAKE_FLAT, MAKE_MOSAIC, and CYCLE_NUMBER.  Group
tidying only applies to the sub-group matching the current frame's
filter and cycle number.  Registration text files with extensions
.find, .off, and .res are also removed.
