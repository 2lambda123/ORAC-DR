# Name:
#    _MAKE_MOSAIC_NCOLOUR_
#
# Purpose:
#    Forms a mosaic for a JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive makes a mosaic from the object frames in the sub-group matching
#    the current frame's filter and cycle number.  It is part of a
#    JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipe.
#
#    The mosaic can be trimmed to the dimensions of a single contributing frame or
#    can extend to include all pixels in contributing frames (see argument TRIM).
#
#    It merely calls the standard _MAKE_MOSAIC_ primitive using the
#    sub-group instead of the current $Grp.
#
# Arguments:
#    FILLBAD = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), replace the bad pixels in the current cycle's
#       mosaic with a smooth function derived from its neighbours. 
#       Otherwise, leave the bad pixels unaltered.  [1]
#    INT_METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The interpolation method.  This is either "linint" for bi-linear
#       interpolation, or "nearest" for nearest neighbour.  The latter
#       takes about half the time.  ["linint"]
#    METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The method used to combine frames to form the mosaic.  See
#       parameter METHOD of CCDPACK/MAKEMOS (SUN/139) for the options.
#       The main two in practice will be "Median" or "Mean".  The former
#       excludes outliers but has problems in good seeing where the
#       registration is poor, as it biases against the peak values of
#       the steepening profile near the core, and hence underestimate
#       the flux.  In this circumstance the mean blurs the psf profile,
#       making it more of a plateau than a sharp peak.  However, the
#       mean preserves the flux, at the cost of the odd rogue value
#       affecting the result.  ["Mean"]
#    RESAMPLE = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), resample the current cycle's frames to the same
#       Cartesian co-ordinate system using the method given by argument
#       INT_METHOD.  If false (0), use integer offsets and changes of
#       origin to register the frames.  The latter is many times
#       faster and is recommended for pipeline operation.
#    TRIM = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), the resampling limits the frame bounds to their
#       original limits, so the mosaic has the dimensions of a single
#       contributing frame.  If false (0), the resampling or shifting
#       imposes no limit to the frame bounds, so the mosaic can extend
#       to include all pixels in contributing frames.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs when the steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is
#    true.
#    -  The group steering header <filter>_GROUP is used to access
#    the sub-group for the current frame's filter.
#    -  The default value of the OPTOV argument of _MAKE_MOSAIC_ is used.
#    -  The updated headers are also propagated back into the current
#    filter group from the sub-group.

=head1 NAME

_MAKE_MOSAIC_NCOLOUR_ -- Forms a mosaic for a JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive makes a mosaic from the object frames in the sub-group matching
the current frame's filter and cycle number.  It is part of a
L<JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR|JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR> recipe.

The mosaic can be trimmed to the dimensions of a single contributing frame or
can extend to include all pixels in contributing frames (see argument TRIM).

It merely calls the standard L<_MAKE_MOSAIC_|_MAKE_MOSAIC_> primitive using the
sub-group instead of the current $Grp.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item FILLBAD = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), replace the bad pixels in the current cycle's
mosaic with a smooth function derived from its neighbours. 
Otherwise, leave the bad pixels unaltered.  [1]

=item INT_METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)

The interpolation method.  This is either "linint" for bi-linear
interpolation, or "nearest" for nearest neighbour.  The latter
takes about half the time.  ["linint"]

=item METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)

The method used to combine frames to form the mosaic.  See
parameter METHOD of CCDPACK/MAKEMOS (SUN/139) for the options.
The main two in practice will be "Median" or "Mean".  The former
excludes outliers but has problems in good seeing where the
registration is poor, as it biases against the peak values of
the steepening profile near the core, and hence underestimate
the flux.  In this circumstance the mean blurs the psf profile,
making it more of a plateau than a sharp peak.  However, the
mean preserves the flux, at the cost of the odd rogue value
affecting the result.  ["Mean"]

=item RESAMPLE = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), resample the current cycle's frames to the same
Cartesian co-ordinate system using the method given by argument
INT_METHOD.  If false (0), use integer offsets and changes of
origin to register the frames.  The latter is many times
faster and is recommended for pipeline operation.

=item TRIM = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), the resampling limits the frame bounds to their
original limits, so the mosaic has the dimensions of a single
contributing frame.  If false (0), the resampling or shifting
imposes no limit to the frame bounds, so the mosaic can extend
to include all pixels in contributing frames.  [0]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.

=item *

Processing only occurs when the steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is
true.

=item *

The group steering header E<lt>filterE<gt>_GROUP is used to access
the sub-group for the current frame's filter.

=item *

The default value of the OPTOV argument of _MAKE_MOSAIC_ is used.

=item *

The updated headers are also propagated back into the current
filter group from the sub-group.
