# Name:
#    _MAKE_MOSAIC_NCOLOUR_
#
# Purpose:
#    Forms a mosaic for a JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive makes an untrimmed mosaic from the object frames in
#    the sub-group matching the current frame's filter and cycle number.
#    It is part of a JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipe.
#
#    It merely calls the standard _MAKE_MOSAIC_ primitive using the
#    sub-group instead of the current $Grp.
#
# Arguments:
#    FILLBAD = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), replace the bad pixels in the current cycle's
#       mosaic with a smooth function derived from its neighbours. 
#       Otherwise, leave the bad pixels unaltered.  [1]
#    INT_METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The interpolation method.  This is either "linint" for bi-linear
#       interpolation, or "nearest" for nearest neighbour.  The latter
#       takes about half the time.  ["linint"]
#    RESAMPLE = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), resample the current cycle's frames to the same
#       Cartesian co-ordinate system using the method given by argument
#       INT_METHOD.  If false (0), use integer offsets and changes of
#       origin to register the frames.  The latter is many times
#       faster and is recommended for pipeline operation.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs when the steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is
#    true.
#    -  The group steering header <filter>_GROUP is used to access
#    the sub-group for the current frame's filter.
#    -  The default value of the OPTOV argument of _MAKE_MOSAIC_ is used.
#    -  The updated headers are also propagated back into the current
#    filter group from the sub-group.

# Arguments
# =========

# Obtain the value for the interpolation.

# Determine whether or not to fill bad pixels.

# Selection
# =========

# Test whether or not it is time to make a mosaic.
    my $makemos = $Frm->hdr( "MAKE_MOSAIC" );
    if ( $makemos ) {

# Obtain the filter.
       my $filter = $Frm->hdr( "FILTER" );

# headers.  This sub-group essentially replaces $Grp in comparison with
# _GENERATE_OFFSETS_JITTER_.

# ================

# Make the group of frames of the appropriate filter in the current cycle
# the local version of $Grp within the context delimited by the braces.

=head1 NAME

_MAKE_MOSAIC_NCOLOUR_ -- Forms a mosaic for a JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive makes an untrimmed mosaic from the object frames in
the sub-group matching the current frame's filter and cycle number.
It is part of a JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipe.

It merely calls the standard _MAKE_MOSAIC_ primitive using the
sub-group instead of the current $Grp.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item FILLBAD = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), replace the bad pixels in the current cycle's
mosaic with a smooth function derived from its neighbours. 
Otherwise, leave the bad pixels unaltered.  [1]

=item INT_METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)

The interpolation method.  This is either "linint" for bi-linear
interpolation, or "nearest" for nearest neighbour.  The latter
takes about half the time.  ["linint"]

=item RESAMPLE = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), resample the current cycle's frames to the same
Cartesian co-ordinate system using the method given by argument
INT_METHOD.  If false (0), use integer offsets and changes of
origin to register the frames.  The latter is many times
faster and is recommended for pipeline operation.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for both UFTI and IRCAM.

=item *

Processing only occurs when the steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is
true.

=item *

The group steering header E<lt>filterE<gt>_GROUP is used to access
the sub-group for the current frame's filter.

=item *

The default value of the OPTOV argument of _MAKE_MOSAIC_ is used.

=item *

The updated headers are also propagated back into the current
filter group from the sub-group.
