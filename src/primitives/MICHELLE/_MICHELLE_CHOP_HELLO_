=head1 NAME

_MICHELLE_CHOP_HELLO_ -- Switches one-integration HDS containers to simple NDF.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive differences multi-beam data and write the beams and
difference as FITS files.  It then merges the NDF components of a
one-integration Michelle observation stored in an HDS container file
into a simple NDF.  History recording is enabled for all integrations.
