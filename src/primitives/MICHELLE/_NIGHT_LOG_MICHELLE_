# Name:
#    _NIGHT_LOG_MICHELLE_

# Purpose:
#    Produces text file logs of a night's Michelle observations.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe takes a night's Michelle observations, and creates text
#    files, one for each observing mode, containing a headed tabulation of
#    parameters for each frame.
#
#    For imaging data the parameters are: observation number, object name,
#    observation type, UT start time, exposure time, number of coadds, read
#    mode and speed, filter, start airmass, frame dimensions in pixels,
#    base equatorial co-ordinates, and data-reduction recipe name.
#
#    For spectroscopic data the parameters are: observation number, the
#    group number, whether or not the data were good, the object name,
#    whether or not the observation is a of standard, observation type,
#    the slit name and angle, the telescope offsets, UT start time,
#    start airmass, exposure time, number of coadds, filter, grating
#    name, grating order, wavelength, and data-reduction recipe name.
# 
# Notes:
#    -  The <date> comes from the internal header ORAC_UTDATE.

# Output Data:
#    -  The text log file $ORAC_DATA_IN/<date>.nightlog, where
#    <date> is the UT date.

_NIGHT_LOG_MICHELLE_ -- Produces text file logs of a night's Michelle observations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe takes a night's Michelle observations, and creates text
files, one for each observing mode, containing a headed tabulation of
parameters for each frame.

For imaging data the parameters are: observation number, object name,
observation type, UT start time, exposure time, number of coadds, read
mode and speed, filter, start airmass, frame dimensions in pixels,
base equatorial co-ordinates, and data-reduction recipe name.

For spectroscopic data the parameters are: observation number, the
group number, whether or not the data were good, the object name,
whether or not the observation is a of standard, observation type,
the slit name and angle, the telescope offsets, UT start time,
start airmass, exposure time, number of coadds, filter, grating
name, grating order, wavelength, and data-reduction recipe name.

The text log file F<$ORAC_DATA_IN/E<lt>dateE<lt>.nightlog>, where
