# Name:
#    _DETERMINE_NREADS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Determines the number of array reads per exposure for ISAAC.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive adds a Frame user header (NREADS), which
#    contains the number of array reads per exposure.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for ISAAC in spectroscopy mode.
#    -  The value comes from the user header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_READS, or
#    if that is undefined, a default of 1 is used.
