=head1 NAME

_USTEP_ONLY_STEER_ -- Steering primitive for ustep combinations only

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive sets up flags that define when you are allowed to interleave
the current ustep sequence. This is only useful with recipes where the highest
level of combination will be ustep sequences. 

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None

=head1 NOTES

The flag $Grp->uhdr("ALLOWED_TO_INTERLEAVE") is set when we have completed the
current ustep sequence. We never allow dithering.
