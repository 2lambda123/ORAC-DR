=head1 NAME

_INTERLEAVE_ -- Work out the microstep offsets between a group of files. The
interleave them to form a superframe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A group of files is given.  If this is only one file, then there obviously
hasn't been any microstepping going on. In this case the current file is
stored away in the $Frm->uhdr("SUPERFRAME") item and nothing further is done.
If there are more than one, then the first thing to do is to work out the
microstep offsets. This is done by looking at the telescope RA and DEC in
the header, relative to the first frame in the group. Once this is done and
the values are written to the data headers, then the interleaving is done
for each file extension.  Both a superframe and a superframe confidence map
are created.
