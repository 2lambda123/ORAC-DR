=head1 NAME

_SELF_FLAT_ -- Combine the images from a group to form a sky flat field.
Flat field correct each frame in the group by using the flat.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When we have been given premission to dither, then combine the images that
comprise the current jitter sequence into a sky flat. Use this sky flat to
correct those self-same input images.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None

=head1 NOTES

At the moment, this routine really can't be used when doing a reduction at
the tile level as it will only reduce the dither appropriate for the last
frame in the tile sequence. This may need to be addressed at some stage.
