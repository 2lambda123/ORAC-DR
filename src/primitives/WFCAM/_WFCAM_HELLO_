=head1 NAME

_WFCAM_HELLO_ -- Load in necessary modules and copy input files to output 
the directory

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The necessary modules are loaded.  ORACDR by default does a soft link from 
the input file to a file in the output directory of the same name.  CIRDR
routines want to overwrite the input files.  So this primitive deletes the
soft link and makes a real copy of the file to the output directory. A 
compressed copy of the file is written to the ORAC_DATA_CASU directory.
Finally some steering parameters are set up to indicate where we are in the
current ustep/jitter/tile sequence.
