=head1 NAME
 
_INTERLEAVE_DITHER_SKYSUB_STEER_ -- Set up flags defining when we are allowed
to begin combining dither and interleave sequences.  

 
=head1 DESCRIPTION
 
This is a steering primitive for the recipe INTERLEAVE_DITHER_SKYSUB. That 
particular recipe only allows for combinations to be done after all of the
frames for a particular tile have been collected.  This is because the sky
subtraction is done by combining all of the frames from the tile in order to
get a good signal-noise ratio in the mean sky frames.
 
=head1 ARGUMENTS
 
None
 
=head1 NOTES
 
Sets the following items in the $Grp->uhdr structure:

=over 4

=item ALLOWED_TO_INTERLEAVE

If set we can interleave the microstep sequences in the current tile

=item ALLOWED_TO_DITHER

If set, we can do a dither combination on each of the jitter sequences in the
current tile.

=item SUPERFRAMES

An anonymous array that is used to hold all the superframes that result from
interleaving the microstep sequences

=item DITHERFRAMES
 
An anonymous array that is used to hold all the stacked frames that result from
dithering the jitter sequences.
