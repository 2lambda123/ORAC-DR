=head1 NAME

_DARK_COMBINE_ -- Form a mean dark frame

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If there is only one frame in the group then this primtive just copies it
to the output file name. If there are more than one then this primitive first 
works out the background values for all the frames in a group. This provides
scaling factors or zero points that can be used to scale the images
to a common median during the combine phase. A combination is done for
each extension. If the dark frame output file already exists, then it is
deleted and the combination is done again. This is to get around the fact that
currently there is no way of 'grouping' dark exposures together in such a way
that you can flag when a sequence of dark exposures is finished. This shouldn't
be a problem though as the timing should be trivial
