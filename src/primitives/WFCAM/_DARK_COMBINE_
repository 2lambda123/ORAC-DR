=head1 NAME

_DARK_COMBINE_ -- Form a mean flat and confidence map

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive first works out the background values for all the frames
in a group. The provide scaling factors that can be used to scale the images
to a common median during the combine phase. A combination is done for
each image in the frames. Once the images are combined the background value
for each of the resulting frames is calculated. Each frame is divided by
the ensemble mean background.  This should not only ensure that the mean
counts for a frame near the ensemble mean remain the same, but also any
pedestal gain difference between the images is also removed. After finishing
with the flat, it is used to create a confidence map.
