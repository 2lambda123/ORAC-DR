=head1 NAME

_INTERLEAVE_AND_DITHER_ -- Interleave and dither the microstep and jitter 
sequences in the current tile group.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This routine will do interleaf and jitter combinations when requested.  Both
operations require and $Grp->uhdr flag to be set.  For interleaving to take
place the flag ALLOWED_TO_INTERLEAVE must be set.  The flag for dithering is
ALLOWED_TO_DITHER. The interleaving section takes processed frames and creates
superframes.  The dithering section takes superframes and creates stacked 
frames.  Once the dithering is done, then all the further cataloguing and DQC
estimates are done.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item IPIX

The minimum size that an object can have in the catalogue (in pixels)

=item THRESH

The detection threshold in numbers of sigma above sky

=item ICROWD

If set, then the catalogue generation will include a deblending algorithm to
try and separate merged objects

=item RCORE

The nominal size of the aperture (in pixels)

=head1 NOTES
