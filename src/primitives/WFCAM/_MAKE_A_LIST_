=head1 NAME

_MAKE_A_LIST_ -- Create a list of files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A running list of frames is written to a file. Once we have enough in the file,
the list is read into memory and then the file is closed and deleted.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item LIST = char (Given)

The name of the file into which to write the file names.

=item NFILE = int (Given)

The number of frames to write to the file. This will trigger reading the 
information into memory and deleting the file.

=back

=head1 NOTES

The $Frm->uhdr value LIST_COMPLETE is set to flag when the number of items
in the list matches the input threshold value (NFILE). When that number has
been reached then the $Frm->uhdr value FILE_LIST is set to a reference to
the array holding the names of the frames.
