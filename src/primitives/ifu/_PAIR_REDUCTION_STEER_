PAIR_REDUCTION_STEER

Control reduction of sky-object pairs

=head1 Description

This is a steering primitive. It does not generate any output frames,
but sets user defined headers in the current frame to control
subsequent reduction.

=head1 Headers

=over 4

=item PAIR_COMPLETE

This header is set to 1 if the current group contains an even number
of frames or 0 otherwise.

=item ON_SOURCE

This header is set to 1 if the observation type is OBJECT and the
telescope offsets are less than 30 arcsec, otherwise 0.

=back

=head1 Notes

It is recommended that the observation type is set to OBJECT/SKY as
appropriate. Sometimes this is inconvenient (when setting a complex 
jitter pattern for use with MAP_EXTENDED_SOURCE the offset iterator in
ORAC-OT may be useful), so any positions with total telescope offset 
sqrt(ra_off^2 + dec_off^2) > 30 arcsec is assumed to be a sky position.
