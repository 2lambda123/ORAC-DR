=head1 NAME

_CREATE_WCS_  -- Corrects the headers of UIST IFU data to enable creation of an AIPS-convention World Co-ordinate System.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive converts astrometric information in a UIST IFU frame into
an AIPS-convention World Co-ordinate System.  This is achieved by
editing the headers in the FITS airlock. The WCS is not created because
it is not currently possible to define a RA, dec, wavelength WCS system.
The WCS frame can be created on images extracted from the datacube. Axes
are created giving the offset from the centre of the fild of view in arcsec.

The changes are listed below.

a) Put decimal degrees of RABASE in CRVAL1, and DECBASE in CRVAL2.
The comment includes a sexagesimal version of the co-ordinate.

b) Change CRPIXI<n> to the centre of the frame or a supplied x-y
reference pixel.

c) Divide CDELTI<n> by 3600 to convert to degrees.  Make CDELT1
negative.

d) Change CTYPE1 to "RA---TAN", CTYPE2 to "DEC--TAN".

e) Revise the comments for the above to adhere to the UKIRT FITS
document, orac0016-fith, e.g. CRVAL1's comment becomes "[deg] RA
(hh:mm:ss.ss) at reference point" with the sexagesimal
position substituted.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item XREF = REAL (Given)

The I<x> pixel index corresponding to the base equatorial position.
This defaults to the centre of the array along the RA axis for
sub-arrays, but 20 pixels into the west half for the full array.  If
supplied beyond the range 0 to 1024 or some non-numeric value
supplied, a warning is issued and the default adopted.  []

=item YREF = REAL (Given)

The I<y> pixel index corresponding to the base equatorial position.
This defaults to the centre of the array along the Declination axis
for sub-arrays, but 25 pixels into the south half for the full array.
If supplied beyond the range 0 to 1024, or some non-numeric value
supplied, a warning is issued and the default adopted.  []

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

Editing only occurs for OBJECT and SKY frames, for which
there is no WCS.  This includes all editing steps.

=item *

The location of the reference pixel is the biggest source
of error, and may vary systematically with telescope operator.
Comparison of real data with the defaults suggests errors
are typically +/-2" in each axis.

=item *

Following a successful introduction of a WCS, the current
AST Frame is SKY.  Any existing WCS Frames besides the default
three---PIXEL, GRID, AXIS---are lost. 

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The modified NDF.
