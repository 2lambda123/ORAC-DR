=head1 Name

_MOSAIC_STEER_

Control mosaicing of datacubes

=head1 Description

If the current frame completes a pair then sky subtraction should have
been carried out before this primitive is called. The sky-subtracted
2d spectrum is formed into a datacube. The spectral direction of the
cuube is divided by a standard star spectrum unles the NOSTD option is
true. The offset in x and y is calculaated from the telescope offsets
and image rotator angle and these offsets are used to mosaic the
datacubes. The final mosaic is flux calibrated unless the NOSTD option
is set. Finally images and a spectrum are extracted from the datacube.

=head1 Parameters

=over 4

=item NOSTD

Prevents division by a standard star spectrum and flux calibration.
