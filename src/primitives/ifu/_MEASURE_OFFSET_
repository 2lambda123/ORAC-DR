=head1 Name

_MEASURE_OFFSET_ -- measures the vertical offset which must be applied to an IFU profile.

=head1 Description

This primitive measures the y-offset which must be applied to the IFU
profile stored in the calibration directory. This value is then filed 
in the calibration system for use when reducing further observations. This
offset is different for each grism.

This primitive should be run on an IFU frame of a uniform source. A flat-field
image would probably be best for this, though arc spectra or even sky 
background would probably be possible. 

The frame is compressed in the x-direction then shifted one pixel at a time
to find the best overlap with the positions of the slices given by the
profile (the position with the highest total transmission over all slices). 

=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

The measured offset is filed with the calibration system for later
use.  The entry stored in the calibration system is of the form
filename:offset (eg: u20030131_00066.I1:19), where the filename is the
file from which the offset was measured, and the offset is in pixels.
