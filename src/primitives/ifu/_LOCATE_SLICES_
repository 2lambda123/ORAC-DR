=head1 NAME

_LOCATE_SLICES_ -- Locates the slices in an IFU frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The positions of the slices are obtained from the ifu_profile.dat file.
The y offset which should be applied to these positions (which is different
for each grism) is obtained from the calibration system.

The positions of the slices and the x and y shift that should be applied
to each one to align them in the y and spectral directions are written
into the USER header in arrays IFU_start, IFU_end, IFU_xshift, 
IFU_yshift with indices from 0 and the number of slices into IFU_slices

The slice positions are placed in the array in the order in which they 
are given in the ifu_profile.dat file. These should be in the order in 
which they are arranged on the sky, rather than in the order in which the
slice images appear on the array in order to allow correct construction
of the datacube.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is written for the UIST IFU.

=item *

The locations of the slices and the shifts which should be applied are
written into the user headers IFU_start, IFU_end, IFU_xshift and
IFU_yshift. Each of these is an array with an element for each slice.


=item *

the number of slices is written to the IFU_slices user header.

=item *

The ifu_profile.dat file has one row for each slice, each containing
four whitespace separated fields (ystart yend xshift yshift). All are
integers except yshift.

=item *

Each grism produces a vertical offset in the position of the spectra. This 
offset is obtained from the calibration system.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

No new file is created. The user headers IFU_start, IFU_end, IFU_xshift 
and IFU_yshift are added to the input file.
