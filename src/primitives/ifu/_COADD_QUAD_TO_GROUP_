=head1 NAME

_COADD_QUAD_TO_GROUP_ -- Coadds a quad to its group.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive coadds the current quad to its group. If the group file
does not exist, the current quad is copied into the appropriate file.

Coaddition is done using CCDPACK/MAKECAL, and as such, any of the
combination methods for CCDPACK/MAKECAL can be used. This primitive
defaults to using a broadened median method, which is suitable for
normal operations.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)

The method for combining quads. This parameter can be any of the methods
listed for frame combination in CCDPACK/MAKECAL (see SUN/139). [broadened]
