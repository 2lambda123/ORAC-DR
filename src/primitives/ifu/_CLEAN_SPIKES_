=head1 NAME

_CLEAN_SPIKES_ - Cleans spikes from an image.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive cleans hot pixels and cosmic ray hits from an image.
It does so using FIGARO/BCLEAN, using the following defaults:

=over 4

=item CRSIG = 5.0

=item CRFACT = 0.50

=item CRMINV = 20.0

=item CRSHARPNESS = 10.0

=item DEGFIX = 5

=item SHARPNESS = YES

=back

What these mean is that for a pixel to be considered "hot", it must be:

=over 4

=item * greater than CRSIG times the square root of the average of its
four neighbours,

=item * greater than CRFACT times the average of its four neighbours,

=item * greater than CRMINV plus the average of its four neighbours, and

=item * the height of the pixel above the immediately surrounding sky must
exceed the difference between the immediately surrounding sky and the
sky a bit further away, by more than a ratio of CRSHARPNESS.

=back

If a hot pixel is found, it is removed by interpolating from neighbouring
pixels with a polynomial of order DEGFIX.

All of these parameters can be modified.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item CRSIG = REAL (Given)

The cosmic ray search algorithm looks at every pixel in the image and
compares its value with the average value of its four nearest neighbours.
To be regarded as a cosmic ray, the pixel must exceed that average value
by an amount greater than CRSIG times the square root of the average value.
Sensible numbers are probably in the range 2.0 to 10.0, but the best way
to tune the operation is to try with a few different values, looking at
the unfixed results to see which pixels were considered cosmic rays. This
constraint is in addition to those enforced by CRFACT and CRMINV. [5.0]

=item CRFACT = REAL (Given)

To be regarded as a cosmic ray, a pixel value must exceed the average of
its neighbours by an amount that exceeds CRFACT times that average value.
This constraint is in addition to those enforced by CRSIG and CRMINV. [0.5]

=item CRMINV = REAL (Given)

To be regarded as a cosmic ray, a pixel value must exceed the average of
its neighbours by at least CRMINV. This constraint is in addition to those
enforced by CRSIG and CRFACT. [20.0]

=item CRSHARPNESS = REAL (Given)

The height of the cosmic ray above the immediately surrounding sky must
exceed the difference between the immediately surrounding sky and the
sky a bit further away, by more than a ratio of CRSHARPNESS. Stars tend
to have lower values of this ratio than cosmic rays. [10.0]

=item DEGFIX = INTEGER (Given)

Bad data areas are interpolated by fitting local polynomials to the
data. DEGFIX is the degree of polynomial to be used. [5]
