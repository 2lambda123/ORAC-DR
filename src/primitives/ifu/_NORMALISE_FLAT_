=head1 NAME

_NORMALISE_FLAT_ -- Call the appropriate spectroscopy flat normalising primitive

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive, despite its name, does not actually do any
normalising, it just chooses the appropriate spectroscopy primitive to
run. This is necesary because most of tyhe data taken during UIST
commissioning does not have the spectroscopy headers needed to run the
_WAVELENGTH_CALIBRATE_BY_ESTIMATION_ primitive, which is required
before the flat can be normalised by a black body spectrum. In therse
cases the _NORMALIZE_FLAT_BY_POLY_ primitve is used instead.
