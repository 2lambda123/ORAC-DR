=head1 NAME

_STANDARD_STAR_

=head1 DESCRIPTION
 
Extracts the spectrum (or positive and negative
spectra if offsetting has been within the field of the IFU), looks up
the magnitude and type of the standard, divides by a blackbody
spectrum and files as a standard. Images are extracted from individual
pairs but not from a coadded group datacube. This shouldn't be a problem
because your standard is likely to be bright.

=head1 PARAMETERS

NBEAMS - 1 if offsetting has been to sky, 2 if offsetting has been
within the field.
