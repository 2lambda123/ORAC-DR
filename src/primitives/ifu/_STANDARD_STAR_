=head1 NAME

_STANDARD_STAR_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Extracts the spectrum (or positive and negative
spectra if offsetting has been within the field of the IFU), looks up
the magnitude and type of the standard, divides by a blackbody
spectrum and files as a standard.

This primitive then forms a datacube from the group image, and extracts
images from that cube.

The optimal extraction spectrum used for extraction is stored with the
calibration system for later use.

=head1 PARAMETERS

NBEAMS - 1 if offsetting has been to sky, 2 if offsetting has been
within the field.
