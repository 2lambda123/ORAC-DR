=head1 NAME

_REMOVE_SKY_NOISE_SCAN_USING_MODEL_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates and removes sky noise from scan map data using the
most recent Group image as a sky model.

Must be run after SCAN_RLB and despiking.

=head1 TASKS

SURF: CALCSKY, REMSKY

=head1 OPTIONS

None

=head1 NOTES

This is a group method since the result improves as more data
are included. The group is split into sub-groups based on chop
configuration and each goup is processed in turn.

If a group output file exists for the current sub-instrument
all members of the group are reprocessed to use the new model
even if they are not related to the current observation.

Note that since this method modifies files that have already been
processed the template() method is used to find out what the
file name was at the current stage of data processing.

This routine doesnt assume that SCAN map data is the input
(will work with jiggle) - this is probably an incorrect
name.
