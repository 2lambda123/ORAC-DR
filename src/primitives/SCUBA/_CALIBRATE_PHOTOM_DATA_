_CALIBRATE_PHOTOM_DATA_ - multiply data by flux conversion factor

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Multiply SCUBA data by the flux conversion factor (FCF).
The value for the FCF depends on the filter.

This is a Frame operation and should be used before
group operations.

Unlike _CALIBRATE_DATA_ this primitive operates on the output
of _CALC_PHOT_RESULT_ and therefore must query the current
file for the *_PEAK ndf files. If the C<_CALC_PHOT_RESULT_> is changed
this primitive must be modified.

I do this so that I can check the gain on reduced data before
I multiply by the gain. This allows me to calculate the
new gain from calibrator observations (stored in the CAL
object for later retrieval).

Otherwise I have to compare the calibrated calibrator with
the known flux of the calibrator and derive the new gain from
it. Obviously this is all a lot easier if I am working with
uncalibrated data.

=head1 OUTPUT

Generates a log file of the flux conversion factors (F<log.fcf>).
