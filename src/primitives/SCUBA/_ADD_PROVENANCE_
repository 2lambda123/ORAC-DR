=head1 NAME                                     -*-perl-*-

_ADD_PROVENANCE_ - Write the input file list in a format suitable for
importation into the FITS header.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For each member of the current group, take the file name, strip off the
directory and extention, then output the resulting file ID as a FITS
keyword/value of the form OBS12345 <ID>.

This primitive forces the FITS extension to exist if it did not already
