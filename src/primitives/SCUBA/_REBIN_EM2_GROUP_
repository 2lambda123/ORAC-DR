=head1 NAME

REBIN_EM2_GROUP

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This group method combines scan map data taken with different chop
throws and removes the dual beam signature using FFTs

=head1 TASKS

The following tasks are used:

=over 4

=item SURF

C<REBIN>, C<SCUMAKEWT>

=item KAPPA

C<FOURIER>, C<ADD>, C<MULT>

=back

=head1 PARAMETERS

Allowed parameters are:

=over 4

=item C<PIXEL_SIZE>

Pixel size in arcsec. Default is 3.0.

=item C<REBIN_METHOD>

Rebin method as used by SURF C<REBIN>. Default is "Gaussian".

=back

=head1 NOTES

This routine only runs for SCAN map observations using LO
chops.

Generates a sub group of data that matches the specified
header values. This routine rebins ALL the subgroups even if 
the groups have already been coadded. This is a bug for simplicity...

The routine does not run unless 4 or 6 chop throw datasets are
available. [Must be sets of identical chops with different
PAs]

Filtering of high frequencies is used as for remdbm with the -filter
option.

When mosiacing the output map centre must be chosen such that
all the data is visible. The easiest thing is simply to take 
the average of all map centres used (inclufing MAP_X and MAP_Y).
This is a pain if some are in RB and some in RJ.

For the dual beam deconvolution to work the output images must 
all be regridded to the same size. This means that the extent
of the map (combined with the new map centre) must be calculated
in terms of the output pixel size. C<REBIN> does this already except
that it wont keep everything fixed [ and if I choose a size that
matches the default size then the source is not guaranteed
to lie at the centre pixel of the regridded image].

The following options are available:

=over 4

=item *

Run REBIN with a single chop set but configure so that it 
doesnt actually rebin. The SIZE parameter can then be read
back. The map centre is first chosen by averaging the map centre
of each field before running C<REBIN>.

=item *

Run SCUBA2MEM and analyse the stats on the output data file.
The problem is that SCUBA2MEM doesnt combine data.
Still need to work out the offsets between files myself.

=item *

Given that we know the spread of map centres Ie the maximum
extent of the observation) and the size of each field that
was used we can make a good guess at the overall extent of the
final map.

=back

In fact we choose to use option 1 (REBIN without an output file).
