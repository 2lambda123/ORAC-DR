=head1 NAME

_DISPLAY_SKYDIP_ - display skydip observation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Display the skydip data and fit for each sub-instrument.
Similar to SURF SDIP.

Currently do not display anything for a sub-instrument
if the fit failed. This may not be the best thing
to do -- in some cases the data may be useful to see
even if the fit fails.

Recommended display mode is DATAMODEL.

=head1 TASKS
