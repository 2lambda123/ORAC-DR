# Reset the parameters in the surf monolith:
# need to do this because otherwise I get the following
# error message every time I call a task from SURF after
# running SCUCAT.
# This is possibly related to the GRP library since the
# only other place this happens with is for CCDPACK
# Error message is:
#!! HDS locator invalid: value=' ', length=15 (possible programming error).
#!  DAT_COPY: Error copying an HDS object to a new structure component.
#!! DAT__LOCIN: Locator invalid
#
# And this occurs after the task has finished during the
# fixed part.
