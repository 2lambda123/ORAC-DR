=head1 NAME

_FORM_REBINNED_CUBES_ - Rebins spectral cubes to supplied velocity channel sizes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates a group co-added cube from all members of the
current group. It then baselines the cube and creates moments maps.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item GROUP = INTEGER (Given)

How to process group files.  0 means use the current Frame object.  1
means use the current Group object.  2 means use each Frame member of
the current Group object.  [1]

=item REBIN = STRING (Given)

A comma-separated list of requested rebinning resolutions, in km/s.  A
rebinned cube will be created for each requested resolution.  Only the
group cube will be rebinned.  A nullvalue results in no rebinned cubes
being created.  This argument can be overridden by the RECPAR_REBIN uhdr
via the recipe parameter system.  []

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ACSIS data.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The rebinned cubes with suffix _<res>bin. The resolution is passed into
the filename such that the decimal point is replaced with a 'p', and
two decimal places are included. For example, for a requested velocity
resolution of 0.1 km/s, each output filename will have a _0p10bin
suffix, and for a requested velocity resolution of 10 km/s, each output
filename will have a _10p00bin suffix.
