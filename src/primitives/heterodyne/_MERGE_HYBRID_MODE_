=head1 NAME

_MERGE_HYBRID_MODE_ - Merge hybrid mode observations in the frequency
domain.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive operates on hybrid-mode observations.  It first
determines a DC-level offset between corresponding subband
observations, using the median of entire spectra.  The DC offset is
added to or removed from the subband spectra, and the corresponding
subband spectra are mosaicked together to form time-series cubes with
a greater frequency extent.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

None.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ACSIS data taken in hybrid mode.

=item *

This primitive only operates if the ISHYBRID user header is set for
the current Frame object.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The DC-corrected time-series cubes with suffix _dc.

=item *

The merged time-series cube with suffix _merge.
