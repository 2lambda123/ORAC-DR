=head1 NAME

_VERIFY_DATA_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive uses statistics to determine if any data are mostly bad,
or contain spectra comprising anomalous values.  Bad is defined as
comprising more than 85% bad values.  Anomalous values are suspected
when the standard deviation exceeds a nominal 500.

In the first case the observation is rejected.  In the second case,
thresholding is applied only to the affected sub-files, wherein the
outliers are flagged as bad.

Since some early raw data have a frequency first axis rather than the
radial velocity expected later in the recipes, the current files may
have their Axis 1 System and Units WCS attributes modified to vrad and
km/s respectively.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item None

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item The thresholding is set between -250 and 500.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item A new NDF is only created if its data required outlier flagging,
and this will have suffix _thr.
