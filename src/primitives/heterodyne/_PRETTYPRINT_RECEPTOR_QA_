=head1 NAME

_PRETTYPRINT_RECEPTOR_QA_ - Pretty-print quality assurance numbers.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes a hash of ACSIS quality assurance numbers and
prints them in a pleasing manner.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item HASH = HASH REFERENCE (Given)

A hash reference pointing to the receptor-specific quality assurance
numbers. Keys are receptor names and values are the specific
value. This argument must be defined.

=item TYPE = STRING (Given)

The type of statistic passed to this primitive. This string is only
used for output. ['RMS']

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ACSIS data.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 TASKS

None.

=head1 REQUIRED PERL MODULES
