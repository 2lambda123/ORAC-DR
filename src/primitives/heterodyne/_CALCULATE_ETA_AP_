# Formulae:
#
# General :-
#
# e_ap = (2k/S.A) * int{Ta'} d Omega_r / int P d Omega_b
# A= geometric area of the antenna
#
#
# T_a' = F_eff * T_a*
# Point source :-
#
# e_ap = (2k/S.A) / T_a'
#
# S = Total flux i.e. not flux in beam.
# flux_in_beam = (Omega_b/Omega_r) * S.
#
# For a disc-like planet
#
# Omega_r = Omega_s/(1-exp(-x**2)) where x = ln2 theta_s /theta_b
#
#######################
#
# Extract the beam size and the
# whether SSB or DSB (see below) from the header also.
#
######################
#
# Use stats to find the mean of the spectrum in T_A* (K)
#
# implement a warning if the standard deviation is high - this could
# mean baseline curvature or the presence of an absorption line.
#
#######################
#
# For DSB receivers we are sensitive to both sidebands
# Thus T*A will be twice as a large (assuming equal sideband
# sensitivity ratio)
#
# if Rx =A then T*_A * 0.5?
#
#
########################
#
# Qu. What is F_eff for the JCMT?
#
# - can get from JCMT_paramters table.
