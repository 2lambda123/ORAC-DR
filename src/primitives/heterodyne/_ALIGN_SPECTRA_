=head1 NAME

_ALIGN_SPECTRA_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive aligns spectra for all members of the current Group to
the first member, where each output NDF just encompasses the corresponding
input NDF.  Otherwise it uses the current parameter values for WCSALIGN.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=item INDEX = INTEGER (Given)

The subfile index of the current file that will be the reference
spectrum, defining the pixel-to-velocity mapping.   If INDEX is undefined,
then the first member of the current group becomes the reference
spectrum, and the current group must contain at least two members.  [undef]

=item SUFFIX = STRING (Given)

Generate spectrally aligned NDFs with this file suffix.  ["_align"]

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item The aligned NDFs.  These have the suffix set by Argument SUFFIX.
