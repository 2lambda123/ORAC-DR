=head1 NAME

_COMPARE_SPECIES_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive compares the molecular species, i.e. the molecule and
transitions of the current Frame or Group (see Argument OBJ) against a
reference dataset (Argument REF).  Depending on the setting of
Argument ABORT, a mismatch will either abort the reduction, or merely
issue a warning listing the differences.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item ABORT = BOOOLEAN (Given)

If set to 1 (true), the if the species do not match, an error message
is reported and the recipe aborts. If set to 0 (false), only a warning
message is reported.  The later caters for cases with missing metadata
where the two observations are of the same molecule and transition.
[0]

=item OBJ = ORAC::Frame/ORAC::Group object (Given)

The ORAC::Frame or ORAC::Group object from which the MOLECULE and TRANSITI
headers are taken.  [current ORAC::Frame object]

=item REF = STRING (Given)

The name of the reference file against which to compare the species.  This 
should currently be an NDF of an ACSIS observation.  An error will occur if
no name is supplied.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

It converts the molecule and transition to the form <molecule(<transition>)
with all whitespace removed.  If there is a mismatch, the message reports the
two species in this form.

=over 4

=head 1 TASKS

None.
