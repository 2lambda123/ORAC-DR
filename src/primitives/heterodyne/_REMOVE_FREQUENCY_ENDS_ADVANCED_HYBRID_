=head1 NAME

_REMOVE_FREQUENCY_ENDS_ADVANCED_HYBRID_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive removes the high-noise regions at either end of the
frequency bounds for hybrid-mode observations. It acts similarly to
_REMOVE_FREQUENCY_ENDS_ADVANCED_, but before doing any trimming,
ensures that there is sufficient overlap in the two subbands to
calculate a proper DC offset for hybrid mode merging. If there is not
enough offset, then a fixed number of channels is removed.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item LOWER = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from the lower end
of the frequency range. For example, if a cube has 1024 channels, and
the percentage to trim is 10, then 102 channels will be trimmed. This
parameter is only used if the advanced algorithm trims too much data
such that not enough channels would overlap when merging the
hybrid-mode observations. [undef]

=item MINIMUM_OVERLAP = INTEGER (Given)

The minimum number of desired channels that will overlap after doing
trimming. If the number of channels is lower than this, then the fixed
number of channels will be trimmed according to the C<LOWER> and
C<UPPER> arguments. [10]

=item UPPER = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from the upper end
of the frequency range. For example, if a cube has 1024 channels, and
the percentage to trim is 10, then 102 channels will be trimmed. This
parameter is only used if the advanced algorithm trims too much data
such that not enough channels would overlap when merging the
hybrid-mode observations. [undef]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is only suitable for ACSIS time-series cubes.

=item *

This primitive will only run if the ISHYBRID uhdr is true.

Cube with removed frequency ends, with the _em suffix appended to the
filename.
