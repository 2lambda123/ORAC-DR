=head1 NAME

_REMOVE_BASELINE_MASKED_TIMESERIES_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive determines a baseline for a time-series cube using
previously-masked time-series data, determined by the
_RECREATE_MASKED_TIMESERIES_ primitive. A high-order polynomial is fit
to the masked data to determine the baseline, which is then subtracted
from the original (unmasked) time-series data.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item ORDER = INTEGER (Given)

The polynomial order that will be used to determine the baseline. As
the masked data will be used, a high order is recommended. [1]

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ACSIS data.

=item *

The masked time-series data filenames must be stored in a hash
reference in the Group MASKED_TIMESERIES uhdr, with the key being the
original unmasked time-series data, and the value being the masked
time-series data.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

Baselined time-series data with _blNNN suffix.
