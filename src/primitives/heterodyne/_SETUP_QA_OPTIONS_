=head1 NAME

_SETUP_QA_OPTIONS_ - Set up options to be passed to JSA::QA Perl module.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive sets up a hash of options to be passed to the JSA::QA
Perl module when quality assurance tests are done. It tells the QA
module to perform iteration (knock out high-Tsys receptors until the
QA passes), and passes in molecule/transition or frequency information.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item OPTS = HASHREF (Returned)

A hash reference containing options to be passed to JSA::QA.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ACSIS data.

=item *

Molecule and transition information is obtained from the MOLECULE and
TRANSITI headers, respectively. If both of them do not equal "NO
LINE", then the two are concatenated and have spaces removed, to get
the string in a format suitable for the JSA::QA parameters file.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 TASKS

None.

=head1 REQUIRED PERL MODULES

None, but see JSA::QA.
