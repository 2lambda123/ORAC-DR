=head1 NAME                                     -*-cperl-*-

_IDENTIFY_SPECBOUNDS_ - Determine the spectral bounds of the emission within a spectral cube.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Frame object (which should contain a spectral axis) is collapsed
along each non-spectral axis to form a single spectrum. This is done
using a "MAX" estimator so that regions of emission are not diluted by
combining them with other regions of non-emission (such as would
happen if, say, a "MEAN" estimator were used). A background curve is
then estimated and subtracted from this collapsed spectrum, and the
regions of emission are then identified using CUPID:FINDCLUMPS. The
upper and lower spectral bounds each region of emission are stored in
the group user-defined header, with key SPECBOUNDS, in the order
lbnd1, ubnd1, lbnd2, ubnd2, etc.

=head1 PARAMETERS
