=head1 NAME

_COLLAPSE_PF_SRC_LINE_ - Collapse a cube of a pointing or focus source

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The region over which the line is collapsed is determined by first
looking in the JCMT pointing catalog.  If that does not give a line
width, then the central non-baseline region is used.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item AXIS = INTEGER (Given)

The axis along which to collapse. [3]

=item SUFFIX = STRING (Given)

The file suffix to use. ['linteg']
