=head1 NAME

_SORT_TIMESERIES_ - Sort timeseries data in time order.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes a set of timeseries cubes and sorts the time
slices into increasing time order. This has the chief advantage of
ensuring that the data has a defined transformation from WCS
coordinates to pixel coordinates. A beneficial side-effect is that the
size of the data files is reduced by purging bad detectors.
