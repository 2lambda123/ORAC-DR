=head1 NAME

_MASK_BAD_BASELINE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive is just an historical wrapper.  The original
functionality is in _MASK_BAD_BASELINE_NOISE_, which did not work
well.  This primitive invokes other primitives better at identifying
bad baselines. The first of which
L<_FLAG_HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_SPECTRA_|_FLAG_HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_SPECTRA_>,
identifies and masks spectra affected by high-frequency noise.
The next
(L<_LOCATE_APPROX_EMISSION_IN_CUBE_|_LOCATE_APPROX_EMISSION_IN_CUBE_>
attempts to locate approximately the astronomical
emission in a time-series cube in preparation for
L<_FLAG_LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE_SPECTRA_|_FLAG_LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE_SPECTRA_>,
which identifies and masks individual spectra affected by low-frequency
noise.  The final primitive,
(L<_MASK_BAD_BASELINE_LINEARITY_|_MASK_BAD_BASELINE_LINEARITY_>,
identifies bad detectors by comparing the deviation from linearity of
each detector's baseline.

See the documentation for these primitives for further details.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

A cleaned version of the supplied time-series cube in which the
spectra exhibiting high-frequency noise are set to bad.  It has the
suffix _hfimasked (for High Frequency Interference).

=item *

A version of the previous time-seris cube, masked where astronomical
emission is located in the Frame, with suffix "_spem".

=item *

A further cleaned version of the previous time-series cube in which the
spectra exhibiting low-frequency noise are set to bad.  It has the
suffix _lfimasked (for Low Frequency Interference).

=item *

A cleaned version of the prevoius time-series cube in which the
detectors with strongly non-linear baselines are set to bad.  It has
the suffix _bllmasked (for BaseLine Linearity).
