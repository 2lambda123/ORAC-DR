=head1 NAME

_MASK_BAD_BASELINE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive is just an historical wrapper.  The original
functionality is in _MASK_BAD_BASELINE_NOISE_, but this primitive
invokes two other primitives better at identifying bad baselines.
The first of which
(L<_MASK_BAD_BASELINE_LINEARITY_|_MASK_BAD_BASELINE_LINEARITY_>
identifies bad detectors by comparing the deviation from linearity of
each detector's baseline.

The second primitive,
L<_FLAG_HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_SPECTRA_|_FLAG_HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_SPECTRA_>,
identifies and masks spectra affected by high-frequency noise.

For a complete set, this primitive should first invoke
L<_FLAG_LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE_SPECTRA_|_FLAG_LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE_SPECTRA_>,
which identifies and masks individual spectra affected by low-frequency
noise.

See the documentation for these primitives for further details.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

A cleaned version of the supplied time-series cube in which the noisy
detectors are set to bad.  It has the suffix _bllmasked (for
BaseLine Linearity).

=item *

A further cleaned version of the _bllmasked time-series cube in which the
spectra exhibiting high-frequency noise are set to bad.  It has the
suffix _hfimasked (for High Frequency Interference).
