=head1 NAME

_GET_TILE_DIMENSIONS_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This determines the square-tile dimension for reduced spectral cubes.
It uses the formula

C<sqrt( MAXSIZE (in MB) / (BYTES_PER_PIXEL * NC) ) - 2 * TILEBORDER>,

where NC is the number of channels obtained from header NCHNSUBS, but
doubled for hybrid data; and the other variables are the input arguments.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item BYTES_PER_PIXEL = INTEGER (Given)

The number of bytes per pixel in the data to be tiled.  [4]

=item MAXSIZE = INTEGER (Given)

The maximum storage size of a tile, measured in megabytes.  [512]

=item TILEBORDER = INTEGER (Given)

The width in pixels of the border where tiles overlap.  This must be a
non-neagtive value.  [0]

=item TILEDIMS = INTEGER (Returned)

The dimension in pixels of the square tile.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The internal Frame header ISHYBRID is tested to see if the data are hybrid.
