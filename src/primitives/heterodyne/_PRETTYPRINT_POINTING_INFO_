=head1 NAME

_PRETTYPRINT_POINTING_INFO_ - Display previously-calculated pointing
statistics.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive displays information gained from pointing reductions.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

Pointing information is contained in a reference to an array of hashes
located in the POINTING_INFO uhdr item for the current Frame
object. Keys 'DAZ', 'DEL', 'DAZ_ERR', 'DEL_ERR', 'METHOD', and
'POINTING' are used.
