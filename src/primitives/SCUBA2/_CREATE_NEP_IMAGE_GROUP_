=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CREATE_NEP_IMAGE_GROUP_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates images of the effective NEP as a function of
the pixel heater and detector bias settings for all Frame objects in
the current Grp. The Grp is sorted into sub-groups based on the
frequency range over which the noise was calculated.

The Frame objects must contain the results of a noise calculation.
