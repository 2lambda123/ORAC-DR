=head1 NAME

_CALCULATE_NOISE_GROUP_ - calculate a white noise image for each subarray

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CALCULATE_NOISE_GROUP_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive calculates a noise image for each setting of heater and
detector bias over one or more frequency ranges.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=item B<FREQHI>

Comma-separated pair of numbers indicating the frequency range (Hz)
over which to measure white noise portion of power spectrum. Default
is 2,10 (i.e. 2-10 Hz).

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to display extra information. Default is 0
(no).

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

On completion the Grp contains a series of Frames, one for each
frequency range/heater/bias setting, each of which contains the
results of the noise calculation.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

A noise file is created for each subarray, heater setting and bias
with the suffix C<_noi>.
