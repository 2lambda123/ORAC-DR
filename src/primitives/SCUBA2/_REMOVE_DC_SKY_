=head1 NAME

_REMOVE_DC_SKY_ - Removes a DC sky value

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  _REMOVE_DC_SKY_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subtracts a mean sky value from an uncalibrated image. An error is
generated if this primitive is run on calibrated data since it is
assumed that this step will have been done already before calibration.

This primitive is an alternative to _REMOVE_PLANE_FROM_IMAGE_.

This is a Frame operation and should be used before group operations.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported

=over 4

=item METHOD

Valid options are MEAN, MEDIAN or MODE. Default is MEAN.

=item LOGFILE

Flag to denote whether to write results of sky removal to a log
file. Default is 1 (true).

=item VERBOSE

Flag to denote whether to print informative messages to the
screen. Default is false (0).

=back

=head1 External Tasks

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA

C<csub>

=back

=head1 FILES

Creates an output file with a C<_sky> extension.

=head1 NOTES

Only deals with 2-D images, not time-series data.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

Does not determine units from input data files.
