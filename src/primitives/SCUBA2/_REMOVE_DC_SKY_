=head1 NAME

_REMOVE_DC_SKY_ - Removes a DC sky value

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  _REMOVE_DC_SKY_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subtracts a mean sky value from an uncalibrated image. An error is
generated if this primitive is run on calibrated data since it is
assumed that this step will have been done already before calibration.

This primitive is an alternative to _REMOVE_PLANE_FROM_IMAGE_.

This is a Frame operation and should be used before group operations.

=head1 External Tasks

The following external tasks are used:

=item KAPPA

C<csub>

=back

=head1 FILES

Creates an output file with a C<_sky> extension.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

Assumes that this step should be done before calibration although it's
a bit late to tell the user that it should have been done at an
earlier step.
