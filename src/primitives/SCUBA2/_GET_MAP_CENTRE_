=head1 NAME

_GET_MAP_CENTRE_ - determine a default map centre

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _GET_MAP_CENTRE_

 _GET_MAP_CENTRE_ IMAGE=$image

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive returns a simple default map centre as an array
reference, suitable for passing to other primitives. The primitive
queries the WCS associated with the input image and uses that
information to determine the map centre. If the coordinates are
offsets, the default centre is returned as (0,0). For absolute
coordinate systems, the C<SkyRef> attribute is queried to obtain the
nominal default map centre. If that does not exist (0,0) is returned.

Future versions could be smart enough to use the image bounds to
estimate the map centre.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has the following argument:

=over 4

=item B<IMAGE>

Name of the image to examine to get the default map centre. The
current Frame file is used if not specified.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

WCSATTRIB

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The primitive hash has a new key C<XYPOS> which contains a reference
to an array with the formatted (X, Y) position in the current
coordinate system.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.
