=head1 NAME

_FIND_POINTING_OFFSETS_ - Determine the pointing offsets in Az/El

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The user may specify the method by which the source position is to be
determined, either by fitting a Gaussian or by calculating the
centroid position. Results are written to the log file C<log.pointing>
as offsets in arcsecs.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=item B<METHOD>

Method to calculate the source position. Supported values are
C<CENTROID> and C<FIT>. The latter calls the _FIND_BEAM_SIZE_
primitive. The default is C<CENTROID>.

=item B<LOGFILE>

A flag to indicate whether log files should be written containing the
results of the flux and noise calculations. Default is true.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to indicate whether informational messages should be 
given to the user. Default is true.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR primitives

_CENTROID_IMAGE_, _FIND_BEAM_SIZE_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

This primitive writes a .ok file in $ORAC_DATA_OUT for the JCMT
POINTING_FOCUS task to calculate the actual pointing offsets used by
the telescope.
