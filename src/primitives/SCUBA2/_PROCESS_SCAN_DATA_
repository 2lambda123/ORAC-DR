=head1 NAME

_PROCESS_SCAN_DATA_ - deal with scan mode data, making an image if appropriate

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_PROCESS_SCAN_DATA_ PERCENT_CMP=75

_PROCESS_SCAN_DATA_ METHOD=REBIN

_PROCESS_SCAN_DATA_ METHOD=QL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A general-purpose primitive which processes scan data according to
given criteria. The processing is directed by the map-making method
and, if the iterative map-maker is to be used, the
percentage-completion parameter which delays the creation of a map
until a certain proportion of the observation has been completed. If
the criteria are not satisfied, the data are flatfielded as an
intermediate step which will help speed up the final map-making step.

For the simple rebinning map-maker, the data have the atmosphere
subtracted and are extinction corrected before creating the map.

The quick-look map-maker may also be used.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<METHOD>

Method to use in making the map. Valid options are C<ITERATE>,
C<REBIN>, or C<QL>. Default is C<ITERATE>.

=item B<PERCENT_CMP>

If specified, this number is the minimum percentage of the observation
that has been completed. The default is 0 to process each file as it
appears on disk. Only accessed if B<METHOD> is C<ITERATE>.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_EXTINCTION_CORRECT_FRAME_, _FLATFIELD_, _MAKEMAP_FRAME_,
_QLMAKEMAP_FRAME_, _REMOVE_PLANE_FROM_IMAGE_

=back

=head1 NOTES

This primitive is primarily designed for the SUMMIT pipeline only.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

If the completion criteria are not satisfied the Frame uhdr entry
C<NOCALIB> is set to 1, otherwise set to 0.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Flatfielded data with suffix C<_ff> are written out during execution,
but deleted once a map has been made (C<ITERATE> only).

A frame mosaic file with extension C<_fmos> will exist (once the
percentage-completion criteria are satisfied, if appropriate).
