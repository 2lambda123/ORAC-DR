=head1 NAME

_RETRIEVE_FASTFLATS_ - retrieve fast-ramp flatfield data from calibration system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_RETRIEVE_FASTFLATS_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A short helper primitive to find and return all of the associated raw
or processed fast-ramp flatfield files stored in the calibration
system for each subarray. The calibration system can only check the
Frame header, not the subheaders. This means that the C<SUBARRAY>
entry must be set to each subarray in turn. Only then can the correct
file be retrieved from the calibration system.

The primitive checks that the relevant file exists in the current
working directory and only returns the filename if it does.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive supports the following argument:

=over 2

=item B<TYPE>

Type of flatfield data to return. May be C<RAW>, C<SETUP> or C<SOL> to
return the raw data, a raw dark fastramp from a SETUP observation, or
a calculated flatfield solution. Default is C<RAW>.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

This primitive uses no external tasks.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

If any suitable fastflats were found, the primitive hash contains the
entries C<FASTFLATS>, which contains a reference to an array of the
fast-ramp flatfield files that exist in the current working directory,
and C<FASTFLATS_SUB>, which contains a reference to a hash of the
fastflats indexed by subarray.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.

=head1 NOTES

The distinction between a C<raw> fastflat and a C<setup> is purely one
of convenience, as in some cases they may point to the same
file. However, a C<setup> fastflat is usually retrieved from a
different observation than the current one, and therefore requires
different rules for retrieval than the usual C<raw> fastflat (which is
always associated with the current observation).
