=head1 NAME

_FIND_FOCUS_OFFSETS_ - Calculate best-fit focus position

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_FIND_FOCUS_OFFSETS_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes the data cube formed by _CREATE_FOCUS_CUBE_ and
loops over each plane (SMU position) to fit the source with a PSF. The
amplitude is stored and used to create a 1-D NDF of amplitude as a
function of focus position. A quadratic is fitted to these data and
the best-fit focus position calculated. The result is written to a log
file if desired.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to indicate whether informational messages should be
given to the user. Default is 1 (true).

=item B<LOGFILE>

Flag to indicate whether to write results to a log file. Default is 1
(yes).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item FIGARO:

FITPOLY

=item KAPPA:

NDFTRACE, TRANDAT

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_CENTROID_IMAGE, _FIT_PSF_, _GET_LOG_PARAMETERS_

=back

=head1 NOTES

The fit for focus position will only be carried out if a source could
be fitted in three or more planes of the cube.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

The focus position derived by this primitive is stored in the log file
C<log.focus>.

=head1 LOGFILE FORMAT

The logfile has the following columns:

=over 4

=item UT

The UT date in C<YYYYMMDD.frac> format.

=item HST

The time of the observation in Hawaii.

=item Obs

The observation number.

=item Source

The source name.

=item Mode

The observing mode.

=item Filter

The specific filter associated with the FCF result.

=item Elevation

The elevation of the observation.

=item CSO

Equivalent CSO tau derived from the tau used to reduce
the observation.

=item Tau

The tau value used for the reduction.

=item Seeing

The seeing value as stored in the header.

=item Axis

The axis (X, Y, or Z) in which the SMU was moved.

=item Pos

Best-fit focus position in mm.
