_CORRECT_FTS_ATMOSPHERIC_TRANSMISSION_

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CORRECT_FTS_ATMOSPHERIC_TRANSMISSION_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitives corrects for atmospheric transmission across the spectral
dimension, given the current PWV and elevation.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates output files with a C<_atm> extension.
The Frame is updated with the output files.
