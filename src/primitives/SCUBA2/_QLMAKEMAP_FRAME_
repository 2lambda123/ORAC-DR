=head1 NAME

_QLMAKEMAP_FRAME_ - make a map using a simple rebinning algorithm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_QLMAKEMAP_FRAME_ PIXSIZE=7.5 SPREAD=LINEAR

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes raw time-series data for the current Frame and
constructs an image. The data are corrected for dark current drifts
(provided dark frames are included), a mean sky signal is removed and
a simple quick extinction correction applied. The data are rebinned
onto a map pixels using a specified pixel-spreading scheme.

This is a many to one operation, with only a single output file
created.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<PIXSIZE>

Size of the output pixels in arcsec. The default is to use the values
stored in the calibration system: 5.8 arcsec at 850 microns, 2.9
arcsec at 450 microns.

=item B<SYSTEM>

Coordinate system for output image. May be any supported by
B<AST>. Default is C<TRACKING>.

=item B<SPREAD>

Desired pixel-spreading scheme. May be either C<NEAREST> for 
nearest-neighbour resampling or C<LINEAR> for bi-linear resampling. 
Default is C<NEAREST>.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item SMURF: 

QLMAKEMAP

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The Frame uhdr entries C<SKY_SUBTRACTION> and C<EXTINCTION> are set to
1 on success.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates a single output file with a C<_fmos> suffix.

=head1 NOTES

The mean sky level is logged in C<log.sky>.
