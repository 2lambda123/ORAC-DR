=head1 NAME

_MAKEMAP_FRAME_

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  _MAKEMAP_FRAME_ PIXSIZE=7.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes timeseries data for the current frame and
constructs an image. This is a many to one operation, with only a
single output file created.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item B<PIXSIZE>

Size of the output pixels in arcsec. The default is to use the values
stored in the calibration object (equal to the bolometer spacing)

=item B<SYSTEM>

Coordinate system for output image. May be any supported by
C<AST>. Default is C<TRACKING>.

=item B<SPREAD>

Desired pixel-spreading scheme. May be either C<nearest> for 
nearest-neighbour resampling or C<linear> for bi-linear resampling. 
Default is C<nearest>.

=back

=head1 ALGORITHMS

SMURF: QLMAKEMAP

=head1 FILE SUFFIX

Creates a single output file with a '_map' suffix.
