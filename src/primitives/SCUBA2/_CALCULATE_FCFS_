=head1 NAME

_CALCULATE_FCFS_ - calculate flux conversion factors for calibrators

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _CALCULATE_FCFS_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For calibrators, derive Flux Conversion Factors (FCFs) which convert
bolometer power in pW to Jy/beam or Jy/arcsec**2. The input image is
first trimmed to the map size given in the header and a background
removed by masking out the source and fitting and subtracting a 2-d
surface. This trimmed and background-subtracted image is then analyzed
to derive the FCFs.

See also the PICARD recipe L<SCUBA2_FCFNEFD|SCUBA2_FCFNEFD>.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The primitive has no arguments.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_CROP_IMAGE_FRAME_, _FIND_CALIBRATION_MAP_, _REMOVE_BACKGROUND_FROM_IMAGE_

=back

=head1 NOTES

This primitive is frame based (C<$Frm>).

The original image on entry is restored in the Frame on
completion. The modified images created in calculating the FCFs are
deleted at the end of the recipe.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

See L<_FIND_CALIBRATION_MAP_|_FIND_CALIBRATION_MAP_> for details of
how the results are stored.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Files with the suffix C<_crop> and C<_back> are created but deleted at
the end of processing.
