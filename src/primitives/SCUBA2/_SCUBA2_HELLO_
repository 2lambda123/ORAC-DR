=head1 NAME

_SCUBA2_HELLO_ - Mandatory introductory primitive

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _SCUBA2_HELLO_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive should be called at the start of all SCUBA-2 DR
recipes. Its primary purpose is to provide some introductory messages
and to check and set a handful of uhdr entries. Dark frames are
removed from the input if necessary (for DREAM/STARE data).

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

None.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The Frame uhdr has a number of new entries:

=over 2

=item OBSEND

Set to 1 if the Frame contains the last data file in the observation,
or if the observation is a SCAN pointing.

=item PERCENT_CMP

Retrieved from the last value in the state structure.

=item PROCESS_FASTFLAT

A flag to indicate that the Frame contains fast-ramp flatfield data
which should be processed.

=back

The current Frame is tagged as C<dark> if it only contains dark data.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.

=head1 NOTES

Probably not required for offline instances of the pipeline.
