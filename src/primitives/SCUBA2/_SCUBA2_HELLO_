=head1 NAME

_SCUBA2_HELLO_ - Mandatory introductory primitive

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _SCUBA2_HELLO_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive should be called at the start of all SCUBA-2 DR
recipes. Its primary purpose is to provide some introductory messages
and to check and set a handful of uhdr entries. Dark frames are
removed from the input if necessary (for DREAM/STARE data).

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

None.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The Frame uhdr entry OBSEND is set to 1 if the Frame contains the last
data file in the observation, or if the observation is a SCAN pointing.

The Frame uhdr entry PERCENT_CMP is retrieved from the last value in
the state structure.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.

=head1 NOTES

Probably not required for offline instances of the pipeline.
