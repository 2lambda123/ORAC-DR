=head1 NAME

_ALIGN_ARRAYS_ - Align all frames to first frame

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _ALIGN_ARRAYS_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes all the sub-scan frames from each sub-array
and regrids them to a reference RA/Dec frame.

If a group file exists, that is the reference, else the first
frame is chosen as reference.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

If no group file is present the primitive should create a non-rotated
RA/Dec reference based on the world coordinates of the first frame.
Currently, if the world coordinates are rotated the output aligned
frames will be rotated (as will be the case for a SCUBA-2 image
aligned with Nasmyth coordinates).

=head1 ALGORITHMS

Uses KAPPA WCSALIGN. This primitive is currently a very general
implementation.

=head1 FILE SUFFIX

Creates an output image per input image, each with a suffix of '_al'.
