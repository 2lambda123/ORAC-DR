=head1 NAME

_PROCESS_DARK_ - Process dark frames

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_PROCESS_DARK_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive deals with dark frames. For the most part it is a no-op
as the raw dark data must be passed to the appropriate map maker for
SCAN data. However, it is conceivable that the mean dark frame is a
desired entity at some point so the ability is there to calculate that.

The outcome of this primitive is that dark frames are stored in the
calibration system, regardless of whether they are processed by
C<calcdark>.

This is a Frame operation and should be used before group operations.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has no arguments.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

NDFCOPY

=item SMURF:

CALCDARK

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The C<isgood> flag is set to false for Frames processed by this
primitive in order to prevent them from being included in mosaicking
steps which process all the Frames in a Group.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates files with the suffix C<_drk>, one per input file, which are
registered with the calibration system.

=head1 NOTES

This primitive should only be called from the REDUCE_DARK recipe which
will in turn only be called if all the files in the current Frame
object are dark frames, and the observing mode is not FLATFIELD or
NOISE.
