=head1 NAME

_ADD_IMAGES_ - Add together a number of NDFs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _ADD_IMAGES_ IN=$imagelistref OUT=$out

 _ADD_IMAGES_ IN=$imagelistref OUT=$out COMP=EXP_TIME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive uses KAPPA C<MATHS> to add up a group of images. The
default method is to add the data arrays, but the user can specify the
name of an NDF (assumed to be located
INPUT_FILE.MORE.SMURF.COMP). This is useful for calculating the total
exposure time for a series of images which are mosaicked together.

C<MATHS> can only handle 26 inputs so if the input list is larger than
that, the list will be added together in groups.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item B<INLIST>

Reference to array of image names. No default.

=item B<OUT>

Name of output file. No default.

=item B<COMP>

Name of NDF component to add. Default is the data array. If specified
then the component is assumed to be under C<.MORE.SMURF>.
