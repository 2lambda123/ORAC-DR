=head1 NAME

_GET_FLAG_FILE_NAME_ - determine the name of a flag file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _GET_FLAG_FILE_NAME_

 _GET_FLAG_FILE_NAME_ FRAME=$Frm PREFIX=$prefix

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pipeline flag files follow a pre-set naming scheme, with a couple of
options to vary the name. Flag file names consist of a prefix (which
defaults to C<s>), the UT date and the current observation number,
ending with a C<.ok> extension. The flag file is a hidden file and
thus the name begins with a dot C<.>.

The user may choose to omit the observation number.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 2

=item B<FRAME>

Frame object to obtain parameters from. Default is the current Frame.

=item B<OBSFLAG>

Indicate whether or not the flag file name should contain the current
observation number. Default is 1 (yes).

=item B<PREFIX>

Prefix for the flag file name. Default is C<s>.

=back

=head1 NOTES

None.
