=head1 NAME

_CHECK_IMAGE_FOR_TARGET_ - check for good pixels near the position of the target source

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  _CHECK_IMAGE_FOR_TARGET_

  _CHECK_IMAGE_FOR_TARGET_ GOODPIX=75

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive examines the central 19x19 pixel area in the current
Frame image and issues a warning if the fraction of pixels with good
values is less than a specified amount. A flag is set for downstream
primitives to use.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 2

=item B<BOX>

Size of the box in pixels to examine. Default is 19.

=item B<GOODPIX>

The fraction of pixels, expressed as a percentage, that must be good
in order to consider the source mapped. Default is 50.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 2

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_FIND_IMAGE_STATISTICS_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The Frame uhdr entry C<NEWIMAGE> is set to -1 if the fraction of good
pixels is less than the specified criterion. Otherwise it is left
unchanged.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.

=head1 NOTES

None.
