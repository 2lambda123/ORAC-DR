=head1 NAME

_SUMMIT_STEER_ - steering primitive for the Summit pipeline

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_SUMMIT_STEER_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive checks and sets a number of uhdr entries which dictate
the processing of data in the Summit pipeline.

If the percentage completion criteria are satisfied and a new Group
image has been created, no further processing will take place; the
recipe simply exits.

This primitive should ONLY be called in summit recipes (denoted by
the C<_SUMMIT> suffix).

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The Frame has a new uhdr entry called C<TCS_INDEX> which stores the
final TCS index entry for data in the current Frame.

The Group uhdr has the entry C<LAST_INDEX> set to 1 if it a) does not
exist or b) exists but is less than the current TCS index indicating a
new observation has started.
