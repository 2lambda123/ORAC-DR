=head1 NAME

_CREATE_BAD_BOLO_MASK_ - Create a bad bolometer mask

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _CREATE_BAD_BOLO_MASK_ BEST_PERCENT=75

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates a bad bolometer mask based on the distribution
of Noise Equivalent Power values. The C<bad> bolometers may be defined
as those which do not meet the (dark) specifications (though see the
B<RELAX> argument below), or as a percentage of the total (see the
B<BEST_PERCENT> argument below).

The best 50 % of bolometers will be used by default (corresponding to
a median cutoff - note that twice the median often corresponds to a
cutoff of about 80 %). No mask is created if both arguments are less
than zero.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<BEST_PERCENT>

The number of bolometers expressed as a percentage of the total which
should be used to create the mask. Default is 50 (equivalent of using
the median). Will be ignored if less than zero (causing B<RELAX> to be
used instead).

=item B<RELAX>

A factor by which the NEP criteria can be relaxed to include
out-of-spec bolometers. A special value of 0 may be given which skips
the creation of a bad-bolo mask (i.e. continue to use all working
bolometers). Default is 1 (no relaxation). Will be ignored if less
than zero.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to display extra information. Default is 1
(yes).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

HISTAT, STATS, THRESH

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The output bad bolometer masks contain three new FITS headers:

=over 4

=item MASK_NEP

NEP value used to define mask

=item NBOLFLAT

Number of bolometers in NEP image (i.e. number of bolometers with
valid flatfield solutions)

=item NBOLMASK

Number of bolometers in the mask

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates an output file for each subarray present with suffix C<_bbm>,
which is stored in the calibration system.
