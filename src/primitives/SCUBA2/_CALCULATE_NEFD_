=head1 NAME

_CALCULATE_NEFD_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculate the Noise Equivalent Flux Density (NEFD) of the current
observation.

The NEFD is calculated using the formula:

   NEFD = noise * sqrt(time)

where noise is in mJy, the time is the total on+off integration
time in seconds. The units of NEFD are therefore mJy/rtHz.

The results are written to a log file (log.nefd).

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following argument is supported

=over 4

=item B<GROUP>

Flag to indicate whether to obtain results from the Group
file. Default is 0 (use the current Frame).

=item B<METHOD>

Preferred estimator for integration time. Valid options are C<MEAN>,
C<MEDIAN> or C<MODE>. Default is C<MEDIAN>.

=item B<USELOG>

Flag to indicate whether or not to write a log file to disk. Default
is 1 (write a log file).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following SCUBA-2 primitives are used: _FIND_IMAGE_STATISTICS_,
_GET_LOG_PARAMETERS_, _FIND_VARIANCE_
