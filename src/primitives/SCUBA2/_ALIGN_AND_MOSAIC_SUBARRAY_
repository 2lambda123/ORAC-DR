=head1 NAME

_ALIGN_AND_MOSAIC_SUBARRAY_ - Align and mosaic subarray frames together

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_ALIGN_AND_MOSAIC_SUBARRAY_ MAKEMOS=0 REBIN=0 METHOD=NEAREST

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive aligns and mosaics the individual subarray frames from
DREAM/SATARE observations into array images either by using KAPPA
WCSALIGN followed by CCDPACK MAKEMOS or performing both steps with
KAPPA WCSMOSAIC. The former approach calls two other primitives to do
the aligning and mosaicking.

This primitive operates on the current Frame object and selects images
in groups of up to four (one for each subarray) and produces a mosaic
of these images. No operation is performed is there is only a single
subarray.

This primitive will skip time-series data.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item B<MAKEMOS>

A flag to denote whether to use CCDPACK MAKEMOS for mosaicking the
images. Default is 0 (no), which uses KAPPA WCSMOSAIC instead. Note
that WCSMOSAIC is significantly faster than calling WCSALIGN and
MAKEMOS separately.

=item B<MAKEMOS_METHOD>

The method by which MAKEMOS combines the images. Default is
C<MEAN>. See the MAKEMOS documentation for a description of the
possible values.

=item B<METHOD>

The method to be used for resampling the aligned images. This
corresponds to the C<method> parameter for WCSMOSAIC and WCSALIGN,
which is different from that for MAKEMOS. See WCSALIGN and/or
WCSMOSAIC documentation for further details. Default value is
C<NEAREST>, which is recommended for robust processing of exposure
time and weights components.

=item B<REBIN>

A flag to determine whether to rebin or resample. Default is
resample. See the WCSMOSAIC/WCSALIGN documentation for further
information.

=item B<SKYREF>

A flag to denote whether to align the images to a celestial coordinate
frame. The default is 0 (false) and the images will be aligned with
either the group file if it exists or the first image in the Frame.

=item B<VERBOSE>

A flag to denote whether the primitive should issue verbose
information messages. Default is true (1).

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

NDFCOPY, WCSMOSAIC

=item CCDPACK:

MAKEMOS

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_GET_REFERENCE_IMAGE_, _ALIGN_ARRAYS_, _CREATE_COMPS_DREAMSTARE_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The uhdr entry C<ALIGNED> is set to 1 on success to indicate that the
images in the Frame are aligned to a common coordinate frame.

If called on time-series data, then the C<SKY_SUBTRACTION> and
C<EXTINCTION> uhdr entries are set.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

An output file is created for each set of up-to-four subarray images
in the Frame with a suffix of C<_arr>.

=head1 NOTES

If the installed version of KAPPA does not support WCSMOSAIC then
B<SINGLESTEP> is set to 0.
