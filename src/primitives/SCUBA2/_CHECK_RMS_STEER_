=head1 NAME

_CHECK_RMS_STEER_ - steering primitive for CHECK_RMS logging

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _CHECK_RMS_STEER_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple steering primitive to determine which data get processed for
C<CHECK_RMS> noise and NEFD statistics logging and sets a Frame uhdr
flag to signal that C<CHECK_RMS> data collection is required.

Data are only collected for pointing and science observations.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

None.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The Frame uhdr has a new entry called C<CHECK_RMS> with a value of 1.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.

This primitive terminates the current recipe (with good status) for
unsupported data.
