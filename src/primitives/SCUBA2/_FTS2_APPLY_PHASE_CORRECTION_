=head1 NAME

_FTS2_APPLY_PHASE_CORRECTION_

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_FTS2_APPLY_PHASE_CORRECTION_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When FTS2 is in the beam, the phase introduced to the resulting interferogram
by FTS2 needs to be accounted for. This task performs the phase correction. It
assumes that the interferograms in the cube are single-sided and therefore employs
the Forman method of phase correction.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates output files with a C<_phs> extension.
The Frame is updated with the output files.

=head1 NOTES

This primitive will operate on interferogram cubes.
