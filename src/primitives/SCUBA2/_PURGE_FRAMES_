=head1 SYNOPSIS

_PURGE_FRAMES_

to delete Frames on the basis of whether a pre-determined flag has
been set.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<GROUP>

An optional ORAC-DR Group object. The default is Grp.

=item B<KEEPLAST>

A flag to denote whether or not the last Frame in the Group object is
to be kept. Default is 0 (no). Should be set to 1 for the SUMMIT
pipeline to ensure Grp files remain on disk.

=item B<NEWIMAGE>

A flag to denote whether to check that a new Group image has been
created before deleting the frames. Default is 1 (yes).

=item B<VERBOSE>

If set to true (1) then feedback will be printed to the
terminal. Default is 0 (false).
