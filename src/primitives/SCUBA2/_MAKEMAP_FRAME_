=head1 NAME

_MAKEMAP_FRAME_

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  _MAKEMAP_FRAME_ PIXSIZE=7.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes timeseries data for the current frame and
constructs an image. This is a many to one operation, with only a
single output file created.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item B<PIXSIZE>

PIXSIZE is the size of the output pixels in arcsec. The default is
equal to the pixel spacing (ie 6 arcsec).

=item B<SYSTEM>

Coordinate system for output image. May be any supported by
C<AST>. Default is C<TRACKING>.

=item B<SPREAD>

Desired pixel-spreading scheme. May be either C<nearest> for 
nearest-neighbour resampling or C<linear> for bi-linear resampling. 
Default is C<nearest>.

=item B<KEEP>

Flag to denote whether to keep the intermeditate files produced by the
iterative map-maker. Warning: setting this to true may result in
significant disk space usage. Default is 0 (delete files).

=item B<METHOD>

Image reconstruction method. May be C<REBIN> to use a simple rebinning
scheme or C<ITER> to use the iterative map-maker. If C<ITER> is
specified then the following parameters must also be set to override
the defaults (which may not do what you want).

=item B<NUMITER>

Number of iterations. Default is 1, which is clearly not a good
choice.

=item B<MODELORDER>

Comma-separated list of model components. See the SMURF documentation
for further details.

=item B<EXPORTNDF>

Flag to indicate whether intermediate files are written out in NDF
format at the end. Default is 0 (do not write as NDF).
