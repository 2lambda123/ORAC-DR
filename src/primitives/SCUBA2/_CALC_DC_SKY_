=head1 NAME

_CALC_DC_SKY_ - Calculate and optionally log a DC sky value

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CALC_DC_SKY_ METHOD=MEDIAN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates a mean sky value from either the specified image or all the
images in the current Frame. If called with an input file, the sky value
will be returned in the primitive hash as C<DCSKY>.

This is a Frame operation and should be used before group operations.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<IMAGE>

Name of image to calculate sky level for. Default is to calculate the
sky level for all the files in the current Frame.

=item B<LOGFILE>

Flag to denote whether to write results of sky calculation to a log
file. Default is 1 (true).

=item B<METHOD>

Valid options are MEAN, MEDIAN or MODE. Default is MEAN.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to print informative messages to the
screen. Default is false (0).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_FIND_IMAGE_STATISTICS_, _ADD_LOG_ENTRY_

=back

=head1 NOTES

This primitive should be called before calibration or mosaicking.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The mean DC sky level for all files is stored in the primitive hash
under C<DCSKY>.
