=head1 NAME

_DISPLAY_GROUP_ - Display (optionally) the current Group image

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _DISPLAY_GROUP_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive asks the display system to display the current Group.

=head1 NOTES

Only displays the image if the Group product is C<newimage> or
C<reduced> to prevent unecessary calls to the display system.

Should be replaced by a call to the general ORAC-DR implementation.
