=head1 NAME

_FIND_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY_ - aperture photometry of image using statistics

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _FIND_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY_ IMAGE=$image

 _FIND_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY_ IMAGE=$image LOGFILE=0 RADIUS=50

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive calculates the integrated intensity, in whatever units
the image is currently using, around a single (point) source that is
assumed to be the only source on the map (so that the sky contribution
can be calculated). The value is corrected for pixel area and has a
background level subtracted from it. The SKY domain is used
throughout; the coordinate system used is the current one as obtained
from the C<system> WCS attribute.

The background is estimated by masking out the source and calculating
the mean value in the image. This method will work well for
DREAM/STARE images or SCAN images made with the iterative map-maker
which have a single point source. The rebinning map maker for SCAN
data will produce a bowl around a bright source which this method will
not cope with.

The integrated intensity is calculated using the following technique:

=over 4

=item 1

Define radius of aperture (input parameter, or default of 20 arcsec)

=item 2

Mask all data outside the calculated radius centred on the given position.

=item 3

Calculate the sum of all valid pixels.

=back

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item IMAGE

Input image. No default.

=item RADIUS

The radius of the aperture in arcsec. Default is 20 arcsec.

=item XYPOS

An array reference containing the formatted X, Y coordinates in the
chosen frame. No default.

=item LOGFILE

A flag to indicate whether a log file should be written containing the
results of the integrated intensity calculation. Default is true.

=item VERBOSE

Flag to indicate whether informational messages should be given to the
user. Default is true.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA

C<ardmask>, C<stats>, C<histat>

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

On completion, the primitive hash C<%_FIND_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY_>
contains the following keys:

=over 4

=item SUM

The sum of all the pixels within the aperture.

=item TOTALFLUX

The total flux within the aperture in units of
signal_units*pixel_units^2.

=item PEAKFLUX

The peak intensity in the aperture

=item SIGMA

The standard deviation in the image

=item NUMGOOD

The number of pixels which contribute to the estimate of the flux

=item NUMPIX

The total number of pixels in the image

=back

The frame object is not updated.

=head1 NOTES

It may be desireable to allow different domains to be used.
