=head1 NAME

_PROCESS_DARK_NOISE_ - calculate a dark white noise image for each subarray

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_PROCESS_DARK_NOISE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive calculates a noise image for each subarray using only
the initial DARK in the observation. If called from the quick-look or
summit pipelines the dark data are processed and left on disk, with an
entry added in the calibration system.

For offline processing, the dark data are stored in their own Frame
object for later processing.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 2

=item B<FREQRANGE>

Comma-separated pair of numbers indicating the frequency range (Hz)
over which to measure white noise portion of power spectrum. Default
is 2,10 (i.e. 2-10 Hz). May be overridden with the C<NOISE_FREQRANGE>
recipe parameter.

=item B<FREQLO>

Lower frequency at which to measure power spectrum. Default is 0.5 Hz.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to display extra information. Default is 1
(yes).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 2

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_CALCULATE_NOISE_, _DELETE_TEMP_FILES_, _DISPLAY_NOISE_, _WRITE_FLAG_FILE_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The current Frame object is updated with the output noise files.

For offline processing:

=over 2

=item * The Frame uhdr contains a new entry, C<DARKSAMPLES>, which lists the
number of samples in the dark files.

=item * The Group object will have a new Frame stored
which contains the processed dark noise data.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

A noise file is created for each subarray with the suffix C<_noi>.

A flag file is created for SETUP observations which contains the names
of the current noise images and flatfield solutions.
