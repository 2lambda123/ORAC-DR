=head1 NAME

_CALCULATE_AVERAGE_POWERSPECTRUM_ - calculate the average power spectrum for all bolometers in each subarray

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CALCULATE_AVERAGE_POWERSPECTRUM_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive calculates and displays the average power spectrum for
each raw data file in the current Frame object. The raw data undergo
basic processing to add padding and remove DC steps before calculating
the power spectrum.

This primitive is designed to be called as part of the QL or SUMMIT
pipelines, so the Frame object should contain no more than four files
(one for each subarray).

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=item B<DISPLAY>

Flag to denote whether the spectra are to be displayed. Default is 1
(yes). Note that if there are more than four files in the Frame, only
the first four will be displayed.

=item B<FLAT>

Flag to specify whether data should be flatfielded. Default is 0 (no).

=item B<KEEP>

Flag to denote whether to keep power spectra files on disk on
exit. Default is 0 (no).

=item B<THRESH>

Threshold (in standard deviations) for defining good bolometers
to include in the average power spectrum. Default is 3.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to display extra information. Default is 0
(no).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

NDFCOPY, SETTITLE

=item SMURF:

SC2CLEAN, SC2CONCAT, SC2FFT

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The power spectra files are pushed onto the intermediates array of the
current Frame object so they can be deleted on exit, unless the user
has set the B<KEEP> parameter to true.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

An average power-spectrum file is created for each subarray with the
suffix C<_avpspec>
