=head1 NAME

_REPROJECT_JSA_TILE - reproject a JSA tile to tangent-plane

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes a JSA tile and reprojects it to tangent-plane
projection.  If the file does not look like a JSA tile (projection
is not HEALPix or TILENUM is undefined) then nothing is done.

If a reprojection occurs then the new file is placed into the
frame.
