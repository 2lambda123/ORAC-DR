=head1 NAME

_CREATE_JSA_CATALOGS_ - Create JSA-style catalogs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes a set of maps and produces JSA style 'extent' and
'peak' catalogs for each of them.  It uses stilts to manipulate
catalogs produced by CUPID FINDCLUMPS.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED: cross-references between maps.
