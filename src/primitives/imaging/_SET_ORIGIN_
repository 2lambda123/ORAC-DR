# Name:
#    _SET_ORIGIN_
#
# Purpose:
#    Sets the origin of an observation.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive sets the origin of an observation, including all
#    integrations, using the ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND and ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND
#    user headers in the frame.  It is needed to correct the raw data
#    from a sub-array for which the origin is still at the default.
#    If either header is undefined, the primitive creates a default
#    origin (1,1).  The origin is not set if ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND does
#    not exist.
#
# Notes:
#    - This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle and
#    UIST in imaging mode.

_SET_ORIGIN_ -- Sets the origin of an observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive sets the origin of an observation, including all
integrations, using the ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND and ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND
user headers in the frame.  It is needed to correct the raw data
from a sub-array for which the origin is still at the default.
If either header is undefined, the primitive creates a default
origin (1,1).  The origin is not set if ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND does
not exist.
