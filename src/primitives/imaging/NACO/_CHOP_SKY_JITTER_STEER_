# Name:
#    _CHOP_SKY_JITTER_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipes through
#    steering headers listed below.  It also reports whether each frame is
#    of the target or of some sky background.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    INITIAL_SKY = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not the first frame of the observation is of the sky. 
#       For ESO data the observation comprises a series of alternating sky
#       and target frames in an object-sky-sky-object pattern, therefore
#       the value is false.
#    JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter.
#    MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to make the flat.  A flat is made once all the
#       frames and the bracketing sky are available.
#    MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not register the frames and make the full mosaic.
#       The grand mosaic is made once all the frames in a cycle are
#       available.
#    REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL
#       A true value specifies the reference sky frame to which all
#       subsequent skies are normalised.  It is true for the first frame
#       and false for all subsequent frames in the observation.
#    SUBTRACT_SKY = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not it is time to subtract the sky.  Sky subtraction
#       occurs once all the frames in a cycle are available.
#    TARGET_OR_SKY = CHARACTER
#       This is "target" for a target frame, and "sky" for a sky calibration
#       frame.  The target and sky alternate for these recipes.
#    TARGET_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       When TARGET_OR_SKY is "target", this counts the target frames,
#       starting from zero.  It is used for interpolation between sky
#       measurements.
#    USE_VARIANCE = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not variance processing is to occur.  This equates to
#       argument USEVAR.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of target frames in the jitter.  It's the n in
#       CHOP_SKY_JITTERn.  If the argument is absent, a value is derived
#       from the number of offsets, as given by internal header
#       ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS.  The formula is
#       (ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS - 1) / 2.  An error results should
#       ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS be even.  If neither is available, 4 is
#       used.  An error state arises if the number of jittered frames is
#       fewer than 3.  The minimum is 3 because this number of blank skies
#       are needed to form a flat field.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for ISAAC or NACO in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.

# By convention there is always an offset to the origin at the end.
# There must be an odd number of offsets (even number of frames).
# Mimic this for ESO.  So assuming the ABBA (object-sky-sky-object)

# the recipe demands number target frames, and number skies.  With
