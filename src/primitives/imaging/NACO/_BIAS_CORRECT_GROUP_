# Name:
#    _BIAS_CORRECT_GROUP_
#
# Purpose:
#    Corrects imaging flat-fielded frames for variable bias.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Filters columnar pattern by forming the median along the columns,
#    and subtracting the deviations about the mean profile from each
#    column.  This is applied to all group members.   See
#    _REMOVE_COLUMN_ROW_STRUCTURE_ for more details.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This is only performed when the stering header MAKE_FLAT in the
#    current Frame is true.
