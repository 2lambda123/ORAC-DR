# Name:
#    _GENERATE_OFFSETS_CHOP_SKY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the offsets between the frames in an CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipe,
#    and registers the frames.
#
# Description:
#    This primitive finds the pixel offsets between the target frames in
#    the current $Grp of a CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipe.  The primitive itself
#    forms a new temporary group to be registered.  For the first cycle
#    of the recipe all its target frames are passed.  On subsequent
#    cycles the mosaic is inserted into the group before the target
#    frames in the current cycle, so that there is a common registration
#    and that mosaics can be added.  The primitive then passes the new
#    group to primitive _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ to do the bulk of the work.
#
#    When argument TELEOFF is true, _GENERATE_TELE_OFFSETS_ is invoked and
#    the derived offsets are used to register with a shift of origin;
#    otherwise _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ is the work horse.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Arguments:
#    COMPLETE = REAL (Given)
#       Completeness of matched features for registration between two 
#       frames to be accepted.  It must be in the range 0.2 to 1.0. [0.4]
#    MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)
#       Minimum number of contiguous pixels above the PERCENTILE level
#       to be considered a registration feature.  It must be at least 6.
#       The default here is for UFTI and the new IRCAM.  For the
#       original IRCAM3 without the magnifier, 6 proved to be 
#       satisfactory.  [12]
#    PERCENTILE = REAL (Given)
#       Percentile threshold for locating objects to register frames. 
#       It must be in the range 75 to 99.9.  The default here is for
#       UFTI and the new IRCAM.  For the original IRCAM3 without the
#       magnifier, 96 proved to be satisfactory.  [99]
#    TELEOFF = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), it will just use the telescope offsets to register.
#       If false (0), it will attempt automatic registration.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for NACO in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object frames, and when the
#    steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is true.  The selected frames
#    are those in the current cycle whose steering header
#    TARGET_OR_SKY is "target".
#    -  The steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the cycle number.
#    -  The _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ argument CENTRAL_SOURCE is FALSE.
#    Thus matching the centroids of a central source is not attempted
#    if automatic registration fails.

=head1 NAME

_GENERATE_OFFSETS_CHOP_SKY_ -- Finds the offsets between the frames in a CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipe, and registers the frames.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive finds the pixel offsets between the target frames in
the current $Grp of a CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipe.  The primitive itself
new temporary group to be registered.  For the first cycle of the
recipe all its target frames are passed.  On subsequent cycles the
mosaic is inserted into the group before the target frames in the
current cycle, so that there is a common registration and that mosaics
can be added.  The primitive then passes the new group to primitive
L<_GENERATE_OFFSETS_|_GENERATE_OFFSETS_> to do the bulk of the work.

When argument TELEOFF is true,
L<_GENERATE_TELE_OFFSETS_|_GENERATE_TELE_OFFSETS_> is invoked and the
derived offsets are used to register with a shift of origin; otherwise
L<_GENERATE_OFFSETS_|_GENERATE_OFFSETS_> is the work horse.

Percentile threshold for locating objects to register frames. 
It must be in the range 75 to 99.9.  The default here is for
UFTI and the new IRCAM.  For the original IRCAM3 without the
magnifier, 96 proved to be satisfactory.  [99]

=item TELEOFF = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), it will just use the telescope offsets to register.
If false (0), it will attempt automatic registration.  [0]

=item *

This primitive is suitable for NACO in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object frames, and when the
steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is true.  The selected frames
are those in the current cycle whose steering header
TARGET_OR_SKY is "target".

The steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the cycle number.
