# Name:
#    _GENERATE_TELE_OFFSETS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the telescope offsets between the frames, and registers the
#    frames.
#
# Description:
#    This primitive finds the pixel offsets between the target frames  
#    in the current $Grp from the telescope offsets, optionally corrected
#    for a moving target.  It then registers the frames in the PIXEL
#    domain.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Arguments:
#    MOVING_TARGET = LOGICAL (Read)
#       If true (1), the source is a moving target and frames are to
#       register the moving target not the fixed stars.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when 
#    steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is true.
#    -  The frames registered using telescope offsets are reported.
#
# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: REGISTER; KAPPA: WCSFRAME.

# Arguments
# =========

# Is there a moving target?
    my $moving_target = $_GENERATE_TELE_OFFSETS_{MOVING_TARGET};
    $moving_target = defined( $moving_target ) ? $moving_target : 0;

# Selection
# =========

# This should only be performed on OBJECT or SKY frames, when it's time
# to make a mosaic.
    if ( ( $Frm->uhdr( "ORAC_OBSERVATION_TYPE" ) eq "OBJECT" ||
           $Frm->uhdr( "ORAC_OBSERVATION_TYPE" ) eq "SKY" ) &&
           $Frm->uhdr( "MAKE_MOSAIC" ) ) {

# Form a list of input file names for CCDPACK tasks.
       my @objects = $Grp->membernames;

# Convert list to comma-separated list.
       my $objlist = join( ",", @objects );

# Create text file to hold the list of input files, one per line.  This
# is needed because expanded lists of files may make the command line too
# long for the ADAM message system.
       unlink( "objlist.inlist$$" );
       open( INLIST, ">objlist.inlist$$" ) ||
         orac_throw "Unable to open objlist.outlist$$ to create a list of frames to process.  Error: $!.\n";
       print INLIST join( "\n", @objects ), "\n";
       close( INLIST );

# Use telescope offsets from the headers.
       _TELE_OFFSETS_ MOVING_TARGET=$moving_target

# Set the co-ordinate system to pixels.
# =====================================

# This is needed because CCDPACK v3.0, which is in the same release
# as KAPPA v0.14-3 uses the WCS.  CCDPACK/REGISTER has a new USEWCS
# parameter which defaults to true, meaning convert the pixel
# co-ordinates in the .off files into the current co-ordinate system
# of each NDF.  We use pixel co-ordinates throughout.  By making the
# change here the REGISTER command line remains unchanged.
       my ( $param1, $param2 );
       if ( starversion_gt( "KAPPA", 'V0.13-6' ) ) {
          $param1 = "ndf='^objlist.inlist$$' frame=pixel";
          $Mon{ "ndfpack_mon" }->obeyw( "wcsframe", "$param1" );
       }

# Register
# ========

# Specify the other parameters for the REGISTER stage.
       $param1 = "inlist='^objlist.inlist$$'";
       $param2 = "fittype=1";

# Register the frames using a shift of origin.  Create the CCDPACK
# TRANSFORM extensions.
       $Mon{ "ccdpack_reg" }->obeyw( "register", "$param1 $param2 accept" );
       unlink( "objlist.inlist$$" );

# Report processing status.
       orac_print "Frames $objlist registered.\n\n";
