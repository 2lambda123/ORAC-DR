# Name:
#    _LAMP_FLAT_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for the LAMP_FLAT recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for the LAMP_FLAT recipe through
#    steering headers listed below.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    DIFFERENCE_PAIR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to subtract pairs.  It is true every second frame.
#    MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to make the flat.  The flat is made once all the
#       jittered target frames in a cycle are available.
#    PAIR_ORDER = LOGICAL
#       Pair subtraction order, true means take second from the first,
#       and false means take the first from the second.  The value is
#       true.
#    POL_CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the polarimetry cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to
#       complete a pass through the recipe for all waveplate angles.  The
#       first cycle is 0.
#    USE_VARIANCE = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not variance processing is to occur.  This equates to
#       argument USEVAR.
#    WAVEPLATE_FLAT = LOGICAL
#       See the argument of the same name.  This header merely propagates
#       the value of the argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of frames in the group.  If absent, the number of
#       offsets, as given by internal header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS, minus
#       one is used.  If neither is available, 6 is used.  An error state 
#       arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer than 6 or is
#       odd numbered.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]
#    WAVEPLATE_FLAT  = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to make a flat for each polarimeter waveplate angle.
#       For non-polarimetric data, the value ofd the argument is immaterial.
#       For polarimetric data, false (0) means combine all waveplate angles
#       to make the flat (there should be an equal number of each angle).  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for ESO infra-red cameras with a
#    calibration lamp.
#    -  Processing only occurs for calibration-lamp frames.
#    -  The data are deemed to be polarimetry if the frame internal
#    header ORAC_FILTER contains the string "pol".
#    -  A list of the distinct filters within the group is stored in an
#    array stored by refereence in the group user header FILTER_LIST.
