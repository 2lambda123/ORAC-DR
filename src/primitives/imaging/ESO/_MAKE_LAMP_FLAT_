# Name:
#    _MAKE_LAMP_FLAT_
#
# Purpose:
#    Makes calibration-lamp flats from the current group of frames.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive makes lamp flats from the DIFFERENCE_GROUP group, one
#    for each combination of filter.  This routine selects the group
#    for the current recipe cycle, and passes it to the generic
#    _MAKE_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_ primitive.  The list of filters within the
#    main Grp is copied to the DIFFERENCE_GROUP group, as is the Grp
#    name.  The current frame is reselected from the DIFFERENCE_GROUP
#    and its MAKE_FLAT flag set to on.
#
# Arguments:
#    CLEAN = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), the frames are cleaned using a box filter to remove
#       any small blemishes.  Pixels deviating by more than 3 standard
#       deviations from its 15x15 pixel neighbourhood are rejected.  This
#       is done iteratively, three times.  If false (0), no cleaning is
#       performed.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for ESO imaging infrared cameras
#    with a calibration lamp.
#    -  Processing only occurs for lamp-type frames, and when the
#    steering header MAKE_FLAT is true.
#    -  The reference to the difference group is stored in the internal
#    group header DIFFERENCE_GROUP.
#
# Output Data:
#    The flat fields.  See _MAKE_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_ for further details.

=head1 NAME

_MAKE_LAMP_FLAT_ -- Makes calibration-lamp flats from the current group of frames.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive makes lamp flats from the DIFFERENCE_GROUP group, one
for each combination of filter.  This routine selects the group for
the current recipe cycle, and passes it to the generic
L<_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_|_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_> primitive.  The list
of filters within the main Grp is copied to the DIFFERENCE_GROUP
group, as is the Grp name.  The current frame is reselected from the
DIFFERENCE_GROUP and its MAKE_FLAT flag set to on.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item CLEAN = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), the frames are cleaned using a box filter to remove any
small blemishes.  Pixels deviating by more than 3 standard deviations
from its 15x15 pixel neighbourhood are rejected.  This is done
iteratively, three times.  If false (0), no cleaning is performed. [0]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ESO imaging infrared cameras
with a calibration lamp.

=item *

Processing only occurs for lamp frames, and when the steering header
MAKE_FLAT is true.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The flat fields.  See L<_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_|_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_> for further details.
