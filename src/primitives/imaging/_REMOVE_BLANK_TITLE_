# Name:
#    _REMOVE_BLANK_TITLE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Removes any NDF blank titles from the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive erases any NDF blank title within each integration in
#    the current Frame.  This is needed after the raw data format changed
#    in 2002 March.  Prior to that date the raw data contained no title.
#    Since then it has a blank title.  This change could result in the
#    loss of the OBJECT name when a processed NDF is converted to FITS,
#    as the title takes precedence over the OBJECT keyword.
#
# Notes:
#    - This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle and
#    UIST in imaging mode.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: NDFTRACE, SETTITLE.

This primitive erases any blank NDF title within each integration in
the current Frame.  This is needed after the raw data format changed
in 2002 March.  Prior to that date the raw data contained no title.
Since then it has a blank title.  This change could result in the loss
of the OBJECT name when a processed NDF is converted to FITS, as the
title takes precedence over the OBJECT keyword.
