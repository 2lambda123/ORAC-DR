# Name:
#    _PERSSON_STANDARD_MAGNITUDE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Obtains the catalogue magnitude of a standard from the Persson catalogue.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive reads the Persson faint-standard catalogue.  A case-
#    and space-insensitive comparison of the supplied object name with 
#    the entries in the table provides a catalogue magnitude in J, H, K,
#    or Ks for a standard star.  The catalogue magnitude is returned
#    through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    CATMAG = REAL (Returned)
#       The catalogue magnitude for the object and current frame's filter.
#       This is set to the NULLMAG if no magnitude is available.
#    CATNAME = CHARACTER (Returned)
#       The object name in the catalogue.  This has superfluous
#       characters removed from the supplied NAME.
#    NAME = CHARACTER (Given).
#       The object name.  This can be Persson Faint Standard catalogue
#       number, or the alternative HST name.
#    NULLMAG = REAL (Given)
#       A null magnitude when the object has no magnitude for the filter.
#       [99.999]
#    WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The name of the waveband.  It may be J, H, K, or Ks.
#       It comes from _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for near-infra-red imagers.
#    -  Processing should only occur when it is time to perform
#    photometry, i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true,
#    however, this primitive does not make that check.  That is to
#    permit photometry of all the contributing frames of a mosaic.
#    -  An error occurs when the WAVEBAND is not one of the allowed
#    options.
#    -  The standard-star catalogue used is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/persson_jhk.dat.
#    An error results when the catalogue cannot be opened.

=item *

This primitive is suitable for near-infra-red imagers.

=item *

Processing should only occur when it is time to perform
photometry, i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true,
however, this primitive does not make that check.  That is to
permit photometry of all the contributing frames of a mosaic.

=item *

An error occurs when the WAVEBAND is not one of the allowed
