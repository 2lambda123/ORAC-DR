# Name:
#    _FILE_SKY_SKY_AND_JITTER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Files a frame as the current sky for a SKY_AND_JITTER recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive files the current frame as the current sky
#    calibration.  It also adds the sky to the index of sky frames. 
#    Both steps are reported.  This should only be used in a recipe
#    of SKY_AND_JITTER family, where the first and thereafter every 
#    (n+1)th frame is sky bracketing an n-point jitter of object
#    frames.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive works for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs when the frame is the sky interspersed
#    in the object frame, i.e. when the steering header FILE_SKY is true.
#    -  The title of the sky calibration is "sky".
#
# Output Data:
#    Frame sky_<n>, where n is the original frame number, is a copy of
#    of the supplied frame.

=head1 NAME

_FILE_SKY_SKY_AND_JITTER_ -- Files a frame as the current sky for a SKY_AND_JITTER recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive files the current frame as the current sky
calibration.  It also adds the sky to the index of sky frames. 
Both steps are reported.  This should only be used in a recipe
of SKY_AND_JITTER family, where the first and thereafter every 
I<(n+1)>th frame is sky bracketing an I<n>-point jitter of object
frames.

=head1 NOTES

=item *

This primitive works for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs when the frame is the sky interspersed
in the object frame, i.e. when the steering header FILE_SKY is true.

=item *

The title of the sky calibration is "sky".

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

Frame sky_I<n>, where I<n> is the original frame number, is a copy of
of the supplied frame.
