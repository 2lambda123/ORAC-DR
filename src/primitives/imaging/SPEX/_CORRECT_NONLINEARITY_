# Name:
#    _CORRECT_NONLINEARITY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Corrects the raw data for detector non-linearity.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive corrects the raw data frame for non-linearity
#    applying the correction given in the IRAF script on the instrument
#    web page.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for SPEX guider array.
#    -  The correction is unknown at present so this is a null
#    primitive.

# Output Data:
#    -  Linearity-corrected frame inheriting the current frame's name
#    but with the _nl suffix.
