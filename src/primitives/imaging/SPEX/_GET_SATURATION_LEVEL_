# Name:
#    _GET_SATURATION_LEVEL_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the SPEX saturation level in ADU the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the SPEX saturation level in ADU for the current
#    frame.
#
#    The saturation level is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    SATURATION = REAL (Returned)
#       The saturation level obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for the SPEX guider array.
#    -  The values are taken from the instrument's Web page, viz.
#    http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/Facility/spex/work/array_params/array_params.html.
#    Currently 5000 times the DIVISOR frame header (number of
#    non-destructive reads times number of coadds).
