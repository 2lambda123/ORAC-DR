# Name:
#    _MAKE_BPM_BY_SIGMA_THRESHOLDING_

# Purpose:
#    Creates a bad-pixel mask from a long dark exposure.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This primitive creates a bad-pixel mask from a long-exposure dark
#    by first determining a sigma-clipped mean and standard deviation,
#    then flagging as bad all pixels a specified number of clipped
#    standard deviations above and below the clipped mean.  All other
#    pixel values are set to 0.  A further mask is applied to exclude
#    the low-value, noisy regions at the top, right and bottom of the
#    detector.  The resultant bad-pixel mask filed in the calibration
#    system.
#
# Arguments:
#    CLIP = CHARACTER (Read)
#       The clipping limits to form a representative mean and standard
#       deviation of pixel values, as a comma-separated list.  ["2,3,3"]
#    MIN_EXPOSURE = REAL (Given)
#       The minimum allowed exposure for the dark frame in seconds.
#       It is constrained to be at least 10.0  [20.0]
#    SIGMA = REAL (Given)
#       The number of clipped standard deviations about the clipped mean
#       beyond which pixels are flagged as bad.  The minimum permitted
#       is 3.0.  [5.0]

# Notes:
#    -  Only operates on DARK frames, intended for SPEX in imaging mode.
#    -  Uses primitive _CLIPPED_STATS_.
#    -  The mask defined the unreliable periphery pixels is
#    $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bad_edges.ard.

# Output Data:
#    The bad pixel mask called bpm_<obsnum>, where <obsnum> is the
#    observation number.

# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: ARDMASK, SETBAD, THRESH

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates a bad-pixel mask from a long-exposure dark
by first determining a sigma-clipped mean and standard deviation,
then flagging as bad all pixels a specified number of clipped
pixel values are set to 0.  A further mask is applied to exclude
the low-value, noisy regions at the top, right and bottom of the
detector.  The resultant bad-pixel mask filed in the calibration
system.

It is constrained to be at least 10.0  [20.0]
