_INSTRUMENT_HELLO_ -- Performs the instrument-specific imaging setup.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive is performs the instrument specific setup for
imaging.  It's needed for the generic L<_IMAGING_HELLO_|_IMAGING_HELLO_>.
In this case it brings the data values in each integration for ND modes
into line with other instruments, and are ADU, not ADU times the
number reads and coadds.  It also reports that the set-up
operations are complete.
