# Name:
#    _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Returns SPEX near-infrared filter characteristics.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
#    or relating to the SPEX near-infrared imaging filters through 
#    arguments.  Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.
#
#  Arguments:
#    EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)
#       The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
#       default is 0.0.
#    WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Returned)
#       The name of the waveband (J,H,K) within the catalogue of standards
#       most appropriate for the current frame's filter.  If the filter is not
#       recognised, WAVEBAND returns " ".
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for SPEX near-infrared photometry.
#    -  The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.
#    -  The recognised filters have names beginning J, H, Ks, and K.
#    -  The mean extinction coefficients are: J: 0.08; H: 0.03; K: 0.07.
#    Zero extinction applies to any other filter.

=head1 NAME

_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_ -- Returns SPEX near-infrared filter characteristics.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
or relating to the SPEX near-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)

The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
default is 0.0.

=item WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Returned)

The name of the waveband (I<J,H,K>) within the catalogue of standards
most appropriate for the current frame's filter.  If the filter is not
recognised, WAVEBAND returns " ".

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for SPEX near-infrared photometry.

=item *

The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.

=item *

The recognised filters have names beginning J, H, and K.

=item *

The mean extinction coefficients are: I<J>: 0.08; I<H>: 0.03; I<K>:
0.07.  Zero extinction applies to any other filter.
