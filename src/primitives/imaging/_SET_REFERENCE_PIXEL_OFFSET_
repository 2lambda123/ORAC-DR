# Name:
#    _SET_REFERENCE_PIXEL_OFFSET_
#
# Purpose:
#    Sets the offsets of the reference pixel of the current frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive determines the displacements of the reference pixel
#    with respect to the centre of the current frame and stores the
#    displacements in the referenceshift calibration system.  The
#    reference pixel is where a star would be placed for photometry
#    or the centre of a chopped and nodded pattern.
#
#    The reference pixel is specified by the ORAC_X_REFERENCE_PIXEL and
#    ORAC_Y_REFERENCE_PIXEL internal headers in the frame.  If either
#    of these does not exist or is undefined, then the reference offset
#    is zero for both axes.
#
# Notes:
#    - This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle and
#    UIST in imaging mode.
#    - There is an information report giving the reference offset
#    for non-zero shifts.
#    - Should be called only from _IMAGING_HELLO_.

_SET_REFERENCE_PIXEL_OFFSET_ -- Sets the offsets of the reference pixel of the current frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive determines the displacements of the reference pixel
with respect to the centre of the current frame and stores the
displacements in the referenceshift calibration system.   The
reference pixel is where a star would be placed for photometry
or the centre of a chopped and nodded pattern.

The reference pixel is specified by the ORAC_X_REFERENCE_PIXEL and
ORAC_Y_REFERENCE_PIXEL internal headers in the frame.  If either of
these does not exist or is undefined, then the reference offset is
zero for both axes.

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle and
UIST in imaging mode.

=item *

There is an information report giving the reference offset for non-zero
shifts.

Should be called only from L<_IMAGING_HELLO_|_IMAGING_HELLO_>.
