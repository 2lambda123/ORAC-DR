# Name:
#    _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Returns UKIRT near-infrared filter characteristics.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
#    or relating to the UKIRT near-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
#    Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.
#
#  Arguments:
#    CATCOL = INTEGER (Returned)
#       The index of the waveband within the catalogue of standards
#       $ORACDR_CAL/fs_izjhklm.dat most appropriate for the current
#       frame's filter.  Counting starts at zero for the leftmost waveband
#       tabulated.  The default is -1.
#    EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)
#       The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
#       default is 0.0.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UKIRT near-infrared photometry.
#    -  The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.
#    -  The recognised filters have names beginning J, H, K, L, L',
#    M, I, and Z.
#    -  The mean extinction coefficients are: I: 0.07, Z: 0.03, J: 0.08;
#    H: 0.03; K: 0.07; L: 0.10; L':0.09, and M: 0.30.  Zero extinction
#    applies to any other filter.

=head1 NAME

_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_ -- Returns UKIRT near-infrared filter characteristics.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
or relating to the UKIRT near-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item CATCOL = INTEGER (Returned)

The index of the waveband within the catalogue of standards
F<$ORACDR_CAL/fs_izjhklm.dat> most appropriate for the current
frame's filter.  Counting starts at zero for the leftmost waveband
tabulated.  The default is -1.

=item EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)

The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
default is 0.0.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UKIRT near-infrared photometry.

=item *

The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.

=item *

The recognised filters have names beginning J, H, K, L, L', M, I, and Z.

=item *

The mean extinction coefficients are: I<I>: 0.07, I<Z>: 0.03, I<J>:
0.08; I<H>: 0.03; I<K>: 0.07; I<L>: 0.10; I<L'>:0.09, and I<M>: 0.30.
Zero extinction applies to any other filter.
