# Name:
#    _CLIPPED_STATS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the clipped mean and standard deviation of an object or sky frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Use progressive sigma-clipping to find a representative mean and
#    standard deviation of an object frame.  The default clipping thresholds
#    give a reasonable approximation to the mode.
#
# Arguments:
#    CLIP = CHARACTER (Read)
#       The clipping limits as a comma-separated list. ["2,3,3"]
#    MEAN = REAL (Write)
#       The calculated clipped mean.
#    SIGMA = REAL (Write)
#       The calculated clipped standard deviation.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Only operates on OBJECT and SKY frames.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: STATS.

_CLIPPED_STATS_ -- Finds the clipped mean and standard deviation of an object or sky frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use progressive sigma-clipping to find a representative mean and
standard deviation of an object frame.  The default clipping thresholds
give a reasonable approximation to the mode.

=item CLIP = CHARACTER (Read)

The clipping limits as a comma-separated list. ["2,3,3"]

=item MEAN = REAL (Write)

The calculated clipped mean.

=item SIGMA = REAL (Write)

The calculated clipped standard deviation.
