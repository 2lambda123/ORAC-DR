# Name:
#    _DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_CHOP_SKY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Flat-fields the target frames for a CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive divides the target frames of a CHOP_SKY_JITTER
#    recipe by the most-recent and matching flat-field frame from
#    the $Cal->flat method.  The input frames are stored in the
#    current $Grp.  Upon completion the target group members are the
#    flat-fielded frames.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for frames in the current cycle, and when
#    the steering header TARGET_OR_SKY is "target" and steering
#    header MAKE_FLAT is true.
#    -  The steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the cycle number.
#    -  For a target frame the file name is stored in the frame's
#    internal header TARGET_TEMPLATE.  For a sky frame the previous
#    target's frame name is read that frame's TARGET_TEMPLATE header.
#    Thus TARGET_TEMPLATE stored the name of the last target frame to
#    be used to make the list of target frames to flat field.
#    -  The frames' titles are each propagated.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Flat-fielded target frames each inheriting its corresponding
#    input frame's name but with the _ff suffix.
#
# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: FLATCOR.

_DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_CHOP_SKY_ -- Flat-fields the target frames for a CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive divides the target frames of a CHOP_SKY_JITTER
recipe by the most-recent and matching flat-field frame from
the $Cal-E<gt>flat method.  The input frames are stored in the
current $Grp.  Upon completion the target group members are the
flat-fielded frames.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for frames in the current cycle, and when
the steering header TARGET_OR_SKY is "target" and steering
header MAKE_FLAT is true.

=item *

The steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the cycle number.

=item *

For a target frame the file name is stored in the frame's header
TARGET_TEMPLATE.  For a sky frame the previous target's frame name is
read that frame's TARGET_TEMPLATE internal header.  Thus
TARGET_TEMPLATE stored the name of the last target frame to be used to
make the list of target frames to flat field.

=item *

The frames' titles are each propagated.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

Flat-fielded target frames each inheriting its corresponding input
frame's name but with the _ff suffix.
