# Name:
#    _DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_
#
# Purpose:
#    Flat-fields the frames within the current group.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive divides the frames of the current $Grp group by
#    the most-recent and matching flat-field frame from $Cal->flat
#    method.  Upon completion the group members are the flat-fielded
#    frames.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when
#    the steering header MAKE_FLAT is true.
#    -  The frames' titles are each propagated.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Flat-fielded frames each inheriting its corresponding input
#    frame's name but with the _ff suffix.
#
# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: FLATCOR.
