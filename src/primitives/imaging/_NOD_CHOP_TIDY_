# Name:
#    _NOD_CHOP_TIDY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Removes unwanted intermediate files for the NOD_CHOP recipe variants.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _dp suffix.
#    Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided by
#    the steering headers MAKE_MOSAIC and CYCLE_NUMBER, and group
#    internal header DIFFERENCE_GROUP.  Registration text files with
#    extension .off are also removed.

=head1 NAME

_NOD_CHOP_TIDY_ -- Removes unwanted intermediate files for the NOD_CHOP recipe variants.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _ff suffix.
Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided by
the steering headers MAKE_MOSAIC and CYCLE_NUMBER, and group internal
header DIFFERENCE_GROUP.  Registration text files with extension .off
are also removed.
