# Name:
#    _NOD_CHOP_TIDY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Removes unwanted intermediate files for the NOD_CHOP recipe variants.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _dp suffix.
#    Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided by
#    the steering headers MAKE_MOSAIC and CYCLE_NUMBER, and group
#    internal header DIFFERENCE_GROUP.  Registration text files with
#    extension .off are also removed.
#
# Notes:
#    -  For scan mode, as indicated by a defined SCAN_INDEX steering
#    header, the registration file pertains to the mosaic corresponding to
#    that scan index.  The mosaic comes from the mosaic group specified by
#    reference using the group user header MOSAIC_GROUP.  The
#    registration file is only removed when the scan cycle number is
#    positive.   The scan cycle number comes by reference from the group
#    user header SCAN_CYCLES.

=head1 NAME

_NOD_CHOP_TIDY_ -- Removes unwanted intermediate files for the NOD_CHOP recipe variants.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _ff suffix.
Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided by
the steering headers MAKE_MOSAIC and CYCLE_NUMBER, and group internal
header DIFFERENCE_GROUP.  Registration text files with extension .off
are also removed.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

For scan mode, as indicated by a defined SCAN_INDEX steering
header, the registration file pertains to the mosaic corresponding to
that scan index.  The mosaic comes from the mosaic group specified by
reference using the group user header MOSAIC_GROUP.  The
registration file is only removed when the scan cycle number is
positive.   The scan cycle number comes by reference from the group
user header SCAN_CYCLES.
