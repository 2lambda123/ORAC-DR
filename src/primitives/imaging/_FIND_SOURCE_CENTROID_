# Name:
#    _FIND_SOURCE_CENTROID_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the centroid of a point source within the current frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive finds the centroid of a point source within a box
#    either centred or displaced from the centre by the telescope
#    offsets and optional additional offsets.  The centroid is measured
#    in pixel co-ordinates.  The point source can be either positive or
#    negative with respect to the background level.
#
#    It defines an initial search box around the expected positions,
#    which is shifted to the maximum or minimum detected pixel within
#    the initial box, depending on the polarity of the source being
#    detected.  There is optional smoothing to remove small noise and
#    hot pixels before locating the extreme-value pixel.
#
# Arguments:
#    ANGLE = REAL (Given)
#       Rotation angle of the declination axis with respect to the
#       frame's y axis measured counter clockwise.
#    BOXSIZE = REAL (Given)
#       The size in arcseconds of the search box in which to find the
#       object's approximate position, using the brightest pixel, or
#       the minimum pixel when POSITIVE is false. [5]
#    CENTRE( 2 ) = REAL (Returned)
#       The centroid pixel co-ordinates.
#    DECOFF = REAL (Given)
#       The approximate declination offset of the centroid of the point
#       source to be measured with respect to the nominal position.  The
#       nominal position is the declination centre of the array plus
#       the Declination telescope offset.  [0.0]
#    FOUND = LOGICAL (Returned)
#       If true, a centroid was found.
#    INIT( 2 ) = REAL (Returned)
#       The initial pixel co-ordinates for the centroid search.
#    POSITIVE = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If 1 (true), the point source is positive, i.e. has values above
#       the sky level.  If 0 (false), the point source is negative. [1]
#    RAOFF = REAL (Given)
#       The approximate right-ascension offset of the centroid of the
#       point source to be measured with respect to the nominal position.
#       The nominal position is the R.A. centre of the array plus the
#       R.A. telescope offset.  [0.0]
#    SMOOTH = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If 1 (0), a 5-by-5-pixel block median smooth is applied before
#       searching for the extreme value.  This removes noise and hot
#       spots from mislocating the search window.  [1]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for infra-red imaging instruments.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object frames.
#    -  The reference pixel is derived from the frame centre and
#    displacements obtained from the referenceoffset calibration
#    (defaulting to null offsets).
#    -  Error messages are issued if the centroid position contains a
#    bad value or the returned status is not OK. 
#    -  Header ORAC_ROTATION---the angle of the chip's y axis with
#    respect to North (positive is anti-clockwise)---is used to convert
#    sky co-ordinate displacements into pixels using a simple rotation
#    matrix.  If this header is absent, no rotation is assumed.   
#    This formulation is satisfactory for the UKIRT's instrument scales
#    and sizes, and its declination range.  A more-sophisticated
#    transformation would be needed near the poles or for wide fields.
#    - Works with either KAPPA V0.13 or V0.14.  The WCS Frame is set to
#    PIXEL for the latter.

=head1 NAME

_FIND_SOURCE_CENTROID_ -- Finds the centroid of a point source within the current frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive finds the centroid of a point source within a box
either centred or displaced from the centre by the telescope
offsets and optional additional offsets.  The centroid is measured
in pixel co-ordinates.  The point source can be either positive or
negative with respect to the background level.

It defines an initial search box around the expected positions,
which is shifted to the maximum or minimum detected pixel within
the initial box, depending on the polarity of the source being
detected.  There is optional smoothing to remove small noise and
hot pixels before locating the extreme-value pixel.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item ANGLE = REAL (Given)

Rotation angle of the declination axis with respect to the
frame's y axis measured counter clockwise.

=item BOXSIZE = REAL (Given)

The size in arcseconds of the search box in which to find the
object's approximate position, using the brightest pixel, or
the minimum pixel when POSITIVE is false. [5]

=item CENTRE( 2 ) = REAL (Returned)

The centroid pixel co-ordinates.

=item DECOFF = REAL (Given)

The approximate declination offset of the centroid of the point source
to be measured with respect to the nominal position.  The nominal
position is the Declination centre of the array plus the declination
telescope offset.  [0.0]

=item FOUND = LOGICAL (Returned)

If true, a centroid was found.

=item INIT( 2 ) = REAL (Returned)

The initial pixel co-ordinates for the centroid search.

=item POSITIVE = LOGICAL (Given)

If 1 (true), the point source is positive, i.e. has values above
the sky level.  If 0 (false), the point source is negative. [1]

=item RAOFF = REAL (Given)

The approximate right-ascension offset of the centroid of the point
source to be measured with respect to the nominal position.
The nominal position is the R.A. centre of the array plus the
R.A. telescope offset.  [0.0]

=item SMOOTH = LOGICAL (Given)

If 1 (0), a 5-by-5-pixel block median smooth is applied before
searching for the extreme value.  This removes noise and hot
spots from mislocating the search window.  [1]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for infra-red imaging instruments.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object frames.

=item *

The reference pixel is derived from the frame centre and displacements
obtained from the referenceoffset calibration (defaulting to null
offsets).

=item *

Error messages are issued if the centroid position contains a
bad value or the returned status is not OK. 

=item *

Header ORAC_ROTATION---the angle of the chip's y axis with respect
to North (positive is anti-clockwise)---is used to convert sky
co-ordinate displacements into pixels using a simple rotation
matrix.  If this header is absent, no rotation is assumed.   
This formulation is satisfactory for the UKIRT's instrument scales
and sizes, and its declination range.  A more-sophisticated
transformation would be needed near the poles or for wide fields.

=item *

Works with either KAPPA V0.13 or V0.14.  The WCS Frame is set to
PIXEL for the latter.
