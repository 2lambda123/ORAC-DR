=head1 NAME

_MOSAIC_JITTER_ - Mosaic a jittered and optionally microstepped group
for WFCAM.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive mosaics a group of WFCAM data taken in a jittered and
optionally microstepped sequence. The frames must have already been
astrometrically calibrated, as they are first aligned in this
primitive by aligning them to a common WCS frame. After this occurs,
they are mosaicked together using the CCDPACK task MAKEMOS.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The frames are mosaicked together using a mean combination. This is
chosen to preserve flux when seeing is good and registration not so
good.

=item *

The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received less
exposure time. The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time.

=item *

For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
improving signal to noise. The exposure time is also summed and stored
in the mosaic's corresponding header. Likewise, the end airmass and UT
headers are updated to match that of the last-observed frame
contributing to the mosaic.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The aligned frames, with suffices _al.

=item *

The cycle mosaic, with suffix _mos_<CYCLE>.

=item *

The cycle mosaic with bad pixels filled, with suffix _fb_<CYCLE>.

=item *

The grand mosaic, with suffix _mos.
