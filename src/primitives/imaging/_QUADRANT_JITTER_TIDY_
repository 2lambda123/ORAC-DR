# Name:
#    _QUADRANT_JITTER_TIDY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Removes unwanted intermediate files for the QUADRANT_JITTER recipe
#    and its variants.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _ff suffix.
#    Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided
#    by the steering headers MAKE_FLAT, MAKE_MOSAIC, and CYCLE_NUMBER.
#    Registration text files with extensions .find, .off, and .res are
#    also removed.
