# Name:
#    _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Returns ClassicCam near-infrared filter characteristics.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
#    or relating to the ClassicCam near-infrared imaging filters through 
#    arguments.  Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.
#
#  Arguments:
#    CATCOL = INTEGER (Returned)
#       The index of the waveband within the catalogue of standards
#       $ORACDR_CAL/persson_jhk.dat most appropriate for the current
#       frame's filter.  Counting starts at zero for the leftmost waveband
#       tabulated.  The default is -1.
#    EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)
#       The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
#       default is 0.0.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for ClassicCam near-infrared photometry.
#    -  The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.
#    -  The recognised filters have names beginning J, H, Ks, and K.
#    -  The mean extinction coefficients are: J: 0.08; H: 0.03; K: 0.07;
#    and Ks 0.07.  Zero extinction applies to any other filter.

_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_ -- Returns ClassicCam near-infrared filter characteristics.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
or relating to the ClassicCam near-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item CATCOL = INTEGER (Returned)

The index of the waveband within the catalogue of standards
F<$ORACDR_CAL/persson_jhk.dat> most appropriate for the current
frame's filter.  Counting starts at zero for the leftmost waveband
tabulated.  The default is -1.

=item EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)

The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
default is 0.0.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ClassicCam near-infrared photometry.

=item *

The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.

=item *

The recognised filters have names beginning J, H, Ks, and K.

=item *

The mean extinction coefficients are: I<J>: 0.08; I<H>: 0.03; I<K>: 0.07;
and I<Ks> 0.07.  Zero extinction applies to any other filter.
