# Name:
#    _STANDARD_MAGNITUDE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Obtains the catalogue magnitude of a standard.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive reads the faint-standard catalogue or its
#    predecessor.  A case- and space-insensitive comparison of the
#    supplied object name with the entries in the table provides a
#    catalogue magnitude in J, H, K, or Ks for a standard star.
#    The catalogue magnitude is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    CATMAG = REAL (Returned)
#       The catalogue magnitude for the object and current frame's filter.
#       This is set to the NULLMAG if no magnitude is available.
#    CATNAME = CHARACTER (Returned)
#       The object name in the catalogue.  This has superfluous
#       characters removed from the supplied NAME.
#    NAME = CHARACTER (Given).
#       The object name.  This can be Persson Faint Standard catalogue
#       number, or the alternative HST name.
#    NULLMAG = REAL (Given)
#       A null magnitude when the object has no magnitude for the filter.
#       [99.999]
#    WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The name of the waveband.  It may be J, H, K, or Ks.
#       It comes from _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_.  ["K"]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for the ClassicCam imager.
#    -  Processing should only occur when it is time to perform
#    photometry, i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true,
#    however, this primitive does not make that check.  That is to
#    permit photometry of all the contributing frames of a mosaic.
#    -  An error occurs when the WAVEBAND is not one of the allowed
#    options.
#    -  Invokes _PERSSON_STANDARD_MAGNITUDE_ to obtain the magnitude and
#    catalogue name.

=head1 NAME

_STANDARD_MAGNITUDE_ -- Obtains the catalogue magnitude of a standard.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive reads the faint-standard catalogue or its predecessor.
A case- and space-insensitive comparison of the supplied object name
with the entries in the table provides a catalogue magnitude in I<J>,
I<H>, I<K>, or I<Ks> for a standard star.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item CATMAG = REAL (Returned)

The catalogue magnitude for the object and current frame's filter.

=item NAME = CHARACTER (Given).

The object name.  This can be Persson Faint Standard catalogue
number, or the alternative HST name.

=item NULLMAG = REAL (Given)

A null magnitude when the object has no magnitude for the filter.
[99.999]

=item WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Given)

The name of the waveband.  It may be J, H, K, or Ks.
It comes from L<_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_|_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_>.  ["K"]

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for the ClassicCam imager.

=item *

Processing only occurs when it is time to perform photometry,
i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true.

=item *

An error occurs when the WAVEBAND is not one of the allowed
options.

=item *

Invokes L<_PERSSON_STANDARD_MAGNITUDE_|_PERSSON_STANDARD_MAGNITUDE_> to
obtain the magnitude and catalogue name.
