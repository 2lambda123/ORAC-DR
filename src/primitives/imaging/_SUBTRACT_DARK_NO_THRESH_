# Name:
#    _SUBTRACT_DARK_NO_THRESH_
#
# Purpose:
#    Subtracts a dark frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive subtracts from the current frame the most-recent and
#    matching dark frame given by $Cal->dark method.  It reports
#    a successful dark subtraction and the frames concerned.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  The dark-subtracted image can be displayed.
#    -  The subtraction assumes the same exposure time for the dark and
#    object frame.  That validation should be done by the $Cal->dark
#    method.
#    -  The frame title is propagated.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Dark-subtracted frame inheriting the frame's name but with the
#    _dk suffix.
#
# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: CALCOR.

_SUBTRACT_DARK_NO_THRESH_ -- Subtracts a dark frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive subtracts from the current frame the most-recent and
matching dark frame given by $Cal-E<gt>dark method.  It reports
a successful dark subtraction and the frames concerned.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.

=item *

The dark-subtracted image can be displayed.

=item *

The subtraction assumes the same exposure time for the dark and
object frame.  That validation should be done by the $Cal-E<gt>dark method.

=item *

The frame title is propagated.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

Dark-subtracted frame inheriting the frame's name but with the _dk suffix.
