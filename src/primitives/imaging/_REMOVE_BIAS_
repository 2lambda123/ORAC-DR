# Name:
#    _REMOVE_BIAS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Subtracts a bias frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive subtracts a zero bias from the current frame; unless
#    the data have variance information and were taken using a non-ND
#    mode (i.e. where the bias has not already been subtracted), whereupon
#    a bias frame, if available, is subtracted.
#
#    For most instruments there is no bias to subtract so it is
#    something of a placeholder primitive.  Its main purpose is to set
#    up CCDPACK for subsequent processing.  For instance, CCDPACK will
#    complain if debiassing is not performed before say flat-fielding.
#    The primitive reports a successful bias subtraction and the frames
#    concerned.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing occurs for all frames.
#    -  Where a bias frame is used, it is the most-recent and matching 
#    given by $Cal->bias method.
#    -  The observing mode (read type) comes from user header
#    ORAC_DETECTOR_READ_TYPE. 
#    -  The bias-subtracted image can be displayed.
#    -  The frame title is propagated.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Bias-subtracted frame inheriting the frame's name but with the
#    _db suffix.
#
# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: DEBIAS.

_REMOVE_BIAS_ -- Subtracts a bias frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive subtracts a zero bias from the current frame; unless
the data have variance information and were taken using a non-ND
mode (i.e. where the bias has not already been subtracted), whereupon
a bias frame, if available, is subtracted.

For most instruments there is no bias to subtract so it is something
of a placeholder primitive.  Its main purpose is to set up CCDPACK for
subsequent processing.  For instance, CCDPACK will complain if
debiassing is not performed before say flat-fielding.  The primitive
reports a successful bias subtraction and the frames concerned.
