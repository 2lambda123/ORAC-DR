# Name:
#    _IMAGING_HELLO_
#
# Purpose:
#    Performs global data-reduction tasks for the IRIS2 instrument.
#    Note that this version is based on a less than current version
#    of the standard _IMAGING_HELLO_ - it really should be returned
#    to that state, leaving all the IRIS2 specific stuff in IRIS2
#    specific primitives
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive does the preparatory work for recipes used by IRIS2.
#
#    It permits display of the raw data, sets the pixel origin, switches
#    on history recording, corrects inter quadrant cross talk, and corrects
#    non-linearity.
#
# Notes:
#    -  The readout lower bounds in the frame internal headers
#    ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND and ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND define the pixel origin. 
#    No origin is set if these do not exist.
#    -  Any AXIS structure and title are removed.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: FITSMOD, HISSET, SETORIGIN.

# Authors:
#    BEC: Brad E. Cavanagh (JAC)
#    CGT: Chris Tinney (AAO) - updated to correct interquadrant crosstalk and linearity

=head1 NAME

_IMAGING_HELLO_ -- Performs global data-reduction tasks for the IRIS2 instrument.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive does the preparatory work for recipes used by IRIS2.

It permits display of the raw data, sets the pixel origin, switches
on history recording, corrects inter quadrant cross talk, and corrects
non-linearity.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The readout lower bounds in the frame internal headers
ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND and ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND define the pixel origin.  No
origin is set if these do not exist.

=item *

Any AXIS structure and title are removed.
