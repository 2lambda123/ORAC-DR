=head1 NAME

_IMAGING_HELLO_ -- Performs global data-reduction tasks for the IRIS2 instrument.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive does the preparatory work for recipes used by IRIS2.

It permits display of the raw data, sets the pixel origin, and switches
on history recording.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The readout lower bounds in the frame internal headers
ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND and ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND define the pixel origin.  No
origin is set if these do not exist.

=item *

Any AXIS structure and title are removed.
