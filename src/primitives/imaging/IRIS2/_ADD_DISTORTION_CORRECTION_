=head1 NAME

_ADD_DISTORTION_CORRECTION_ -- Adds a correction factor for field distortions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive edits the WCS information for an image so that any
field distortions are corrected for. It currently corrects for a
pincushion distortion on IRIS2.

The primitive reports a successful addition of distortion correction.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

IRIS2 suffers from a pincushion distortion. The correcting equation is
R = R'(1 - 2.4988e-6*R' - 4.4466e-11*R'*R'*R') (from
http://www.aao.gov.au/iris2/iris2_dist.html).
