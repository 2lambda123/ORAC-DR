=head1 NAME

_GET_GAIN_ -- Finds the IRIS2 gain in electrons per ADU for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the gain in electrons per ADU for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value from the header.  If this
is null or less than 1.0, the primitive uses a default value based
upon the time of observation, and it reports the use of the default.

The gain is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item GAIN = REAL (Returned)

The gain obtained.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is only suitable for IRIS2.

=item *

The gain comes from the user header ORAC_GAIN header.  The default
value is 5.2.
