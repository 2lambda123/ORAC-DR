=head1 NAME

_GET_READNOISE_ -- Finds the IRIS2 readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value from the calibration system.
Where there is no value the primitive assigns a default value of 15.

The readnoise is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item READNOISE = REAL (Returned)

The readnoise obtained.
