# Name:
#    _THRESHOLD_FRAME_
#
# Purpose:
#    Thresholds data so that pixels above saturation get bad staus.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Thresholds data so that pixels above saturation get bad staus.
#
# Notes:
#    -  Low threshold of -1000 should never be reached.
#    -  High threshold of 40000 for IRIS2.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Frame inheriting the current frame's name but with the _cl suffix.

# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: THRESH.

=head1 NAME

_THRESHOLD_FRAME_ -- Thresholds data so that pixels above saturation get bad staus.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive marks pixels below -1000, or above 40000, as bad.
IRIS2 DRM data values outside this range are probably saturated.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for IRIS2.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

Thresholded frame inheriting the current frame's name
but with the _cl suffix.

=item *
