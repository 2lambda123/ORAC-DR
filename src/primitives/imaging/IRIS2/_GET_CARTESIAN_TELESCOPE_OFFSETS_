# Name:
#    _GET_CARTESIAN_TELESCOPE_OFFSETS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the telescope offsets for the current frame measured in pixels.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the telescope offsets from the headers of the
#    current frame, and converts them to Cartesian pixel offsets.  It
#    applies x and y scaling and the rotation matrix.  The offsets are
#    returned in two arguments.
#
# Arguments:
#    ANGLE = REAL (Given)
#       Rotation angle of the Declination axis with respect to the
#       frame's y axis measured counter clockwise.  [Value of
#       ORAC_ROTATION header or 0.0 if the header does not exist]
#    XOFF = REAL (Returned)
#       The telescope offset along the x axis of the current frame
#       measured in pixels.
#    YOFF = REAL (Returned)
#       The telescope offset along the y axis of the current frame
#       measured in pixels.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for IRIS2 in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  Internal header ORAC_ROTATION---the angle of the chip's y axis
#    with respect to North (positive is anti-clockwise)---is used to
#    convert sky co-ordinate displacements into pixels using a simple
#    rotation matrix.  If this header is absent, no rotation is assumed.
#    This formulation is satisfactory for the UKIRT's instrument scales
#    and sizes, and its declination range.  A more-sophisticated
#    transformation would be needed near the poles or for wide fields.
#    -  The telescope-offset internal headers are ORAC_RA_TELESCOPE_OFFSET
#    and ORAC_DEC_TELESCOPE_OFFSET.  The platescale headers come from
#    primitive _GET_PLATE_SCALE_.

_GET_CARTESIAN_TELESCOPE_OFFSETS_ -- Finds the telescope offsets for the current frame measured in pixels.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the telescope offsets from the headers of the
current frame, and converts them to Cartesian pixel offsets.  It
applies x and y scaling and the rotation matrix.  The offsets are
returned in two arguments.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item ANGLE = REAL (Given)

Rotation angle of the Declination axis with respect to the
frame's y axis measured counter clockwise.  [Value of
ORAC_ROTATION internal header or 0.0 if the header does not exist]

=item XOFF = REAL (Returned)

The telescope offset along the x axis of the current frame
measured in pixels.

=item YOFF = REAL (Returned)

The telescope offset along the y axis of the current frame
measured in pixels.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for IRIS2 in imaging mode.

=item 4

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.

=item *

Internal header ORAC_ROTATION---the angle of the chip's y axis with
respect to North (positive is anti-clockwise)---is used to convert sky
co-ordinate displacements into pixels using a simple rotation matrix.
If this header is absent, no rotation is assumed. This formulation is
satisfactory for the UKIRT's instrument scales and sizes, and its
declination range.  A more-sophisticated transformation would be
needed near the poles or for wide fields.

=item *

The telescope-offset internal headers are ORAC_RA_TELESCOPE_OFFSET and
ORAC_DEC_TELESCOPE_OFFSET. The platescale headers come from
_GET_PLATE_SCALE_.
