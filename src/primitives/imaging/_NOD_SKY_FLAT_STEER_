# Name:
#    _NOD_SKY_FLAT_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for NOD_SKY_FLAT recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for NOD_SKY_FLAT recipes through
#    steering headers listed below.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    DIFFERENCE_PAIR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to subtract pairs.  It is true every second frame.
#    DO_APHOT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not perform aperture photometry.  Photometry occurs
#       after the mosaic is made.
#    FLAT_DIVIDE = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to flat field.  Flat-fielding occurs at the
#       completion of each cycle of NUMBER frames.
#    MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to make the flat.  The flat is made when all
#       the sky frames in the first cycle are available.
#    MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not register the frames and make the mosaic.  The mosaic
#       is made once all the jittered frames in a cycle are available.
#    MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
#       jittered frames in a cycle are available.
#    PAIR_ORDER = LOGICAL
#       Pair subtraction order, true means take second from the first,
#       and false means take the first from the second.
#    REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL
#       A true value specifies the reference frame for normalisation
#       of the sky frames. It is true for the first sky frame and false
#       for subsequent sky frames in the observation.
#    TARGET_OR_SKY = CHARACTER
#       This is "target" for a target frame, and "sky" for a sky calibration
#       frame.  In this recipe the order is target-sky-target-sky.
#    USE_VARIANCE = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not variance processing is to occur.  This equates to
#       argument USEVAR.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of frames in the sequence.  If absent, the number of
#       offsets, as given by internal header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS, minus
#       one is used.  If neither is available, 8 is used.  An error state 
#       arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer than 8 and not a
#       multiple of 8.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object frames.
