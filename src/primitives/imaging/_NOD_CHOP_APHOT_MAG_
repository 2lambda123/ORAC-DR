# Name:
#    _NOD_CHOP_APHOT_MAG_
#
# Purpose:
#    Performs aperture photometry for NOD_CHOP recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive computes photometry for a NOD_CHOP mosaic by
#    combining the four individual images into one, partioning the
#    mosaic symmetrically.  It centroids about the nominal positions of
#    the two positive and two negative images before co-adding.  It
#    invokes _FIXED_APERTURE_MIDIR_PHOTOMETRY_ to derive aperture
#    photometry for this combined source.   
#
#  Arguments:
#     APERTURE = REAL (Given)
#        The aperture in arcseconds for the photometry.  [3.0]
#     INNER = REAL (Given)
#        The ratio of the diameters of inner ring of the sky annulus to
#        that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained
#        to be in the range 1.1 to 3.0.  The mode of the pixel values in 
#        the annulus is used to subtract the sky for statistics 3) and
#        4) listed above.  [2.0]
#     SKY_EST = INTEGER (Given)
#        Sky estimations method as per AUTOPHOTOM parameter SKYEST.  The
#        default is the mode, so as to exclude contaminating sources.
#        1 is the mean; 2 is the average of values within two standard
#        deviations of the mean; 3 is the mode from PHOTOM, 4 is a 
#        multiply clipped mean emulating the mode but without involving
#        the median.  It is supplied as a constant to AUTOPHOTOM (hence
#        option 4).  The final option is to cope with self-flat frames
#        with a spike artifact in the histogram thus giving the wrong
#        median, and hence biased mode.  The default is used should 
#        the supplied value not be one of the allowed options. [4]
#     OUTER = REAL (Given)
#        The ratio of the diameters of outer ring of the sky annulus to
#        that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained to
#        be in the range 1.4 to 5.0 and be at least 0.3 greater than the
#        inner scale factor of the annulus.  [3.0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for Michelle in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs when it is time to perform photometry,
#    i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true, and only on object
#    frames.
#    -  The steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the recipe cycle
#    number, which is used as the suffix passed to the photometry
#    routine.
#    -  Invokes L<_COMBINE_CHOPPED_SOURCE_|_COMBINE_CHOPPED_SOURCE_> to
#    produce the combined image and some neighbouring background.

#  type recipes only provide a small area around each star image.  This
#  default should include most if not all pixels beyond the inner radius.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive computes photometry for a NOD_CHOP mosaic by
combining the four individual images into one, partioning the
mosaic symmetrically.  It centroids about the nominal positions of
the two positive and two negative images before co-adding.  It
invokes L<_FIXED_APERTURE_MIDIR_PHOTOMETRY_|_FIXED_APERTURE_MIDIR_PHOTOMETRY_>
to derive aperture photometry for this combined source.   

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item APERTURE = REAL (Given)

The aperture in arcseconds for the photometry.  [3.0]

=item INNER = REAL (Given)

The ratio of the diameters of inner ring of the sky annulus to
that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained
to be in the range 1.1 to 3.0.  The mode of the pixel values in 
the annulus is used to subtract the sky for statistics 3) and
4) listed above.  [2.0]

=item SKY_EST = INTEGER (Given)

Sky estimations method as per AUTOPHOTOM parameter SKYEST.  The
default is the mode, so as to exclude contaminating sources.
1 is the mean; 2 is the average of values within two standard
deviations of the mean; 3 is the mode from PHOTOM, 4 is a 
multiply clipped mean emulating the mode but without involving
the median.  It is supplied as a constant to AUTOPHOTOM (hence
option 4).  The final option is to cope with self-flat frames
with a spike artifact in the histogram thus giving the wrong
median, and hence biased mode.   The default is used should 
the supplied value not be one of the allowed options. [4]

=item OUTER = REAL (Given)

The ratio of the diameters of outer ring of the sky annulus to
that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained to
be in the range 1.4 to 5.0 and be at least 0.3 greater than the
inner scale factor of the annulus.  [3.0]
