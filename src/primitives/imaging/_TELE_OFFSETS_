# Name:
#    _TELE_OFFSETS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds telescope offsets for the frames in the current group.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive finds the jitter offsets for the members of the
#    current group of frames.  It uses the telescope offsets in
#    frame headers.  The offsets and the registration method are
#    reported.
#
#    The resultant offsets are written to the corresponding
#    CCDPACK/FINDOFF ".off" offset file for each frame.  Each
#    offset file is recorded in its corresponding frame as if the
#    registration were found automatically.
#
#    Offsets may also be adjusted for a moving target.
#
# Arguments:
#    ANGLE = REAL (Given)
#       Rotation angle of the Declination axis with respect to the
#       frame's y axis measured counter clockwise.
#    MOVING_TARGET = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), the source is a moving target and frames are to
#       register the moving target not the fixed stars.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  User header ORAC_ROTATION---the angle of the chip's y axis with 
#    respect to North (positive is anti-clockwise)---is used to convert
#    sky co-ordinate displacements into pixels using a simple rotation
#    matrix.  If this header is absent, no rotation is assumed.   
#    This formulation is satisfactory for the UKIRT's instrument scales
#    and sizes, and its declination range.  A more-sophisticated
#    transformation would be needed near the poles or for wide fields.

=head1 NAME

_TELE_OFFSETS_ -- Finds approximate pixel offsets for the frames in the current group.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive finds the jitter offsets for the members of the
current group of frames.  It uses the telescope offsets in
frame headers.  The offsets and the registration method are
reported.

The resultant offsets are written to the corresponding
CCDPACK/FINDOFF ".off" offset file for each frame.  Each
offset file is recorded in its corresponding frame as if the
registration were found automatically.

Offsets may also be adjusted for a moving target.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item ANGLE = REAL (Given)

Rotation angle of the Declination axis with respect to the
frame's y axis measured counter clockwise.

=item MOVING_TARGET = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), the source is a moving target and frames are to
register the moving target not the fixed stars.  [0]

=head1 NOTES

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.

=item *

User header ORAC_ROTATION---the angle of the chip's y axis with
respect to North (positive is anti-clockwise)---is used to convert sky
co-ordinate displacements into pixels using a simple rotation matrix.
If this header is absent, no rotation is assumed. This formulation is
satisfactory for the UKIRT's instrument scales and sizes, and its
declination range.  A more-sophisticated transformation would be
needed near the poles or for wide fields.
