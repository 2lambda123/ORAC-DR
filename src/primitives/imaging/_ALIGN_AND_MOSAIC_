=head1 NAME

_ALIGN_AND_MOSAIC_ - Align and mosaic a group of images.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive aligns a group of images that have already been
astrometrically calibrated, then mosaics them together.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item FILLBAD = LOGICAL (Given)

=item REBIN_METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)

The resampling method to be used when aligning images. This can be any
of those listed for the METHOD parameter to
WCSMOSAIC. Nearest-neighbour is quickest, but the default is
SincSinc. This argument is case-insensitive. [sincsinc]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive uses the KAPPA WCSMOSAIC task to do alignment and
mosaicking. This task appeared in KAPPA v1.5, so any earlier versions
will fail.

=item *

The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas that have received
less exposure time. The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time.

=item *

For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
improving signal to noise. The exposure time is also summed and stored
in the mosaic's corresponding header. Likewise, the end airmass and UT
headers are updated to match that of the last-observed frame
contributing to the mosaic.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The cycle mosaic, with suffix _mos_<CYCLE>.

=item *

The cycle mosaic with bad pixels filled, with suffix _fb_<CYCLE>.

=item *

The grand mosaic, with suffix _mos.
