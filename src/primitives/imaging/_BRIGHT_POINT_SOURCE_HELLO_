# Name:
#    _BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE_HELLO_
#
# Purpose:
#    Sets up data-reduction tasks for BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Sets up CCDPACK-related global parameters for BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE
#    recipes.  The settings are as follows.
# 
#    -  The readout bounds in the internal headers ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND,
#    ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND, ORAC_X_UPPER_BOUND, ORAC_Y_UPPER_BOUND define
#    the pixel limits for processing, i.e. there are no bias strips
#    and interpolation direction.  
#    -  Error processing is disabled so the readout noise and
#    analogue-to-digital conversions are not specified.
#    -  There is no deferred charge.
#    -  Position list processing tasks expect to find the names of lists
#    stored within NDFs. 
#    -  Logging is to the terminal.
#    -  The data type of NDF arrays is preserved.
#    -  Does not detect saturated pixels.
#    -  Parameters are neither saved from or to a `restoration' file.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.

# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: CCDSETUP.

_BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE_HELLO_ -- Sets up data-reduction tasks for BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE recipes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets up CCDPACK-related global parameters for BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE
recipes.  The settings are as follows.

=over 4

=item *

The readout bounds in the internal headers ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND,
ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND, ORAC_X_UPPER_BOUND, ORAC_Y_UPPER_BOUND define the
pixel limits for processing, i.e. there are no bias strips and
interpolation direction.

=item *

Error processing is disabled so the readout noise and
analogue-to-digital conversions are not specified.

=item *

There is no deferred charge.

=item *

Position list processing tasks expect to find the names of lists
stored within NDFs. 

=item *

Logging is to the terminal.

=item *

The data type of NDF arrays is preserved.

=item *

Does not detect saturated pixels.

=item *

Parameters are neither saved from or to a `restoration' file.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.
