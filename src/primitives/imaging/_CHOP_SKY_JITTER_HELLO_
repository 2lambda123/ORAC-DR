# Name:
#    _CHOP_SKY_JITTER_HELLO_
#
# Purpose:
#    Sets up data-reduction tasks and data for CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Sets up CCDPACK-related global parameters for CHOP_SKY_JITTER
#    recipes.  The settings are as follows.

#    -  The readout bounds in the internal headers ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND,
#    ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND, ORAC_X_UPPER_BOUND, ORAC_Y_UPPER_BOUND define
#    the pixel limits for processing, i.e. there are no bias strips and
#    interpolation direction.  
#    -  Error processing is disabled so the readout noise and
#    analogue-to-digital conversions are not specified.
#    -  There is no deferred charge.
#    -  Position list processing tasks expect to find the names of lists
#    stored within NDFs. 
#    -  Logging is to the terminal.
#    -  The data type of NDF arrays is preserved.
#    -  Does not detect saturated pixels.
#    -  Parameters are neither saved from or to a `restoration' file.
#
#    The script also performs the following tasks.
#    -  Calls the steering primitive to set steering headers.
#    -  Calls _PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME_ primitive to create error,
#    subtract integrations for chopped data, remove the bias,
#    and create a valid world co-ordinate system.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of target frames in the jitter.  If the argument is
#       absent, a value is derived from the number of offsets, as given
#       by internal header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS.  The formula is
#       ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS / 2 - 1.  An error results should
#       ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS be odd.  If neither is available, 9 is
#       used.  An error state arises if the number of jittered frames
#       is fewer than 3.  The minimum is 3 because this number of blank
#       skies are needed to form a flat field.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.

# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: CCDSETUP.

_CHOP_SKY_JITTER_HELLO_ -- Sets up data-reduction tasks and data for CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets up CCDPACK-related global parameters for CHOP_SKY_JITTER
recipes.  The settings are as follows.

=over 4

=item *

The readout bounds in the internal headers ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND,
ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND, ORAC_X_UPPER_BOUND, ORAC_Y_UPPER_BOUND define the
pixel limits for processing, i.e. there are no bias strips and
interpolation direction.

=item *

Error processing is disabled so the readout noise and
analogue-to-digital conversions are not specified.

=item *

There is no deferred charge.

=item *

Position list processing tasks expect to find the names of lists
stored within NDFs. 

=item *

Logging is to the terminal.

=item *

The data type of NDF arrays is preserved.

=item *

Does not detect saturated pixels.

=item *

Parameters are neither saved from or to a `restoration' file.

=back

The script also performs the following tasks.

=over 4

=item *

Calls the steering primitive to set steering headers.

=item *

Calls L<_PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME|_PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME_> primitive to
create error, subtract integrations for chopped data, remove the bias,
and create a valid world co-ordinate system.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)

The number of target frames in the jitter.  If the argument is
absent, a value is derived from the number of offsets, as given
by internal header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS.  The formula is
ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS / 2 - 1.  An error results should
ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS be odd.  If neither is available, 9 is
used.  An error state arises if the number of jittered frames
is fewer than 3.  The minimum is 3 because this number of blank
skies are needed to form a flat field.  []

=item USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)

Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]
