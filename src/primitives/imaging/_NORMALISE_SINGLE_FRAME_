=head1 NAME

_NORMALISE_SINGLE_FRAME_  -- Normalises a single frame to its mode.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive determines the clipped mean (effectively the mode)
for the current frame, then uses that mean to normalise the entire
frame through division.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for IRCAM, Michelle, UFTI, and UIST in
imaging mode.

=item *

This primitive will act on any image passed to it.

=item *

The normalised image can be displayed.

=item *

The frame title is propagated.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

but with the _nm suffix.
