# Name:
#    _SUBTRACT_DARK_
#
# Purpose:
#    Subtracts a dark frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive subtracts from the current frame the most-recent and
#    matching dark frame given by $Cal->dark method.  It reports
#    a successful dark subtraction and the frames concerned. 
#
#    Since transient `hot' and `cold' pixels can be present despite the 
#    application of a bad-pixel mask, the primitive also thresholds the
#    dark-subtracted frame, setting values beyond the limits to be bad
#    (i.e. undefined), to remove these non-physical values.  Such values
#    can lead to problems later in the pipeline.  In a sense this
#    processing step augments the bad-pixel mask.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for infrared imaging.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object, sky, and flat frames.
#    -  The dark-subtracted image can be displayed.
#    -  The subtraction assumes the same exposure time for the dark and
#    object frame.  That validation should be done by the $Cal->dark
#    method.
#    -  The lower threshold limit is the clipped mean (mode) minus five
#    standard deviations, subject to the constraint that the limit lies
#    between -100 and 1.   The upper limit is 1000 above the nominal
#    saturation level for the instrument and its mode.
#    -  The primitive issues a warning if the dark-subtracted frame's
#    mode is negative, allowing for the error of the mode.  It aborts
#    with an error message if the modal dark-subtracted signal is more
#    than one standard deviation negative.
#    -  The frame title is propagated.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Dark-subtracted frame inheriting the frame's name but with the
#    _dk suffix.
#    -  An array with bad-value substitution beyond thresholds and
#    inheriting the frame's name but with the _th suffix.

_SUBTRACT_DARK_ -- Subtracts a dark frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive subtracts from the current frame the most-recent and
matching dark frame given by $Cal-E<gt>dark method.  It reports
a successful dark subtraction and the frames concerned.

Since transient `hot' and `cold' pixels can be present despite the
application of a bad-pixel mask, the primitive also thresholds the
dark-subtracted frame, setting values beyond the limits to be bad (i.e.
undefined), to remove these non-physical values.  Such values can lead
to problems later in the pipeline.  In a sense this processing step
augments the bad-pixel mask.
