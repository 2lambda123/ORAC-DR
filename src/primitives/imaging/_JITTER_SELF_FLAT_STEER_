# Name:
#    _JITTER_SELF_FLAT_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for JITTER_SELF_FLAT recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for JITTER_SELF_FLAT recipes through
#    steering headers listed below.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    DO_APHOT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not perform aperture photometry.  Photometry is
#       performed once the mosaic is made.
#    JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter.
#    MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to make the flat.  The flat is made once all the
#       jittered target frames in a cycle are available.
#    MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not register the frames and make the mosaic.  The mosaic
#       is made once all the jittered target frames in a cycle are available.
#    MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
#       jittered frames in a cycle are available.
#    REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL
#       A true value specifies the reference frame for normalisation
#       of the masked frames.  It is true for the first frame
#       and false for all subsequent frames in the observation.
#    TARGET_OR_SKY = CHARACTER
#       This is "target" for a target frame, and "sky" for a sky calibration
#       frame.  All frames should be target.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of frames in the jitter.  If absent, the number of
#       offsets, as given by internal header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS, minus
#       one is used.  If neither is available, 9 is used.  An error state 
#       arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer than 3.  []
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.

# flat-field creation with objects masked, a mosaic created, and
# aperture photometry performed.

       $Frm->uhdr( "CYCLE_NUMBER", int( $Grp->num / $number ) );

# Insert the number of frames in the jitter.

# targets from sky frames.

steering headers listed below.

Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.

=item DO_APHOT = LOGICAL

Whether or not perform aperture photometry.
Photometry is performed once the mosaic is made.

=item JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER

=item MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL

Whether or not to make the flat.  The flat is made once all the
jittered target frames in a cycle are available.

=item MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL

Whether or not register the frames and make the mosaic.  The mosaic
is made once all the jittered target frames in a cycle are available.

=item MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL

Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
jittered frames in a cycle are available.

=item REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL

A true value specifies the reference frame for normalisation
of the masked frames.  It is true for the first frame
and false for all subsequent frames in the observation.

=item TARGET_OR_SKY = CHARACTER

This is "target" for a target frame, and "sky" for a sky calibration
frame.  All frames should be target.

The number of frames in the jitter.  If absent, the number of offsets,
as given by internal header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS, minus one is used.
If neither is available, 9 is used.  An error state arises if the
