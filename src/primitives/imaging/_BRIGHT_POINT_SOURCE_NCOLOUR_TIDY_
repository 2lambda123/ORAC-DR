=head1 NAME

_BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE_NCOLOUR_TIDY_ -- Removes unwanted intermediate files for the BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE_NCOLOUR recipe and its variant.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _ff suffix.
Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided by
the steering headers MAKE_MOSAIC and CYCLE_NUMBER. Group tidying
only applies to the sub-group matching the current frame's filter
and cycle number.  Registration text files with extensions .find,
.off, and .res are also removed.
