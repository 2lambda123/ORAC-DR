# Name:
#    _DEFINE_IRPOL_BEAM_SEPARATIONS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Defines the separations of the e-o beams on the chip for
#    polarimetry imaging with ISAAC.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Specifies the default fixed e-o beam separations in polarimetry
#    images with ISAAC.  The values are selected by filter.  It uses
#    the approximate offsets for bands J, H, and K.
#
# Arguments:
#    DECOFF = REAL (Returned)
#       The separation of the e-beam and o-beam in Declination in
#       arcseconds.  The sense is e-beam minus the o-beam position on
#       the chip.
#    RAOFF = REAL (Returned)
#       The separation of the e-beam and o-beam in Right Ascension
#       measured in arcseconds.  The sense is e-beam minus the o-beam
#       position on the chip.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for ISAAC.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  Default values are used for any other filter name.

_DEFINE_IRPOL_BEAM_SEPARATIONS_ -- Define the separations of the e-o beams on the chip for IRPOL imaging with ISAAC.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the default fixed e-o beam separations in polarimetry
images with ISAAC.  The values are selected by filter.  It uses
the approximate offsets for bands I<J>, I<H>, and I<K>.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item DECOFF = REAL (Returned)

The separation of the e-beam and o-beam in Declination in
arcseconds.  The sense is e-beam minus the o-beam position on
the chip.

=item RAOFF = REAL (Returned)

The separation of the e-beam and o-beam in Right Ascension
measured in arcseconds.  The sense is e-beam minus the o-beam
position on the chip.
