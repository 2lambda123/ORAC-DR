# Name:
#    _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Returns ISAAC near-infrared filter characteristics.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
#    or relating to the ISAAC near-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
#    Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.
#
#  Arguments:
#    CATCOL = INTEGER (Returned)
#       The column index of the standards catalogue $ORACDR_CAL/fs_izjhklm.dat
#       most appropriate for the filter.  The default is -1.
#    EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)
#       The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
#       default is 0.0.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for ISAAC near-infrared photometry.
#    -  The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.
#    -  The recognised filters have names beginning Js, J, H, Ks, L,
#    SZ, and Z, as well as various narrow-band filters.  The latter
#    are assigned characteristics of their corresponding broadband
#    filter.
#    -  The mean extinction coefficients are: SZ: 0.09, Z: 0.08, J: 0.11;
#    Js: 0.06; H: 0.06; Ks: 0.07; L: 0.08; and NBM: 0.30.  Zero extinction
#    applies to any other filter.

=head1 NAME

_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_ -- Returns ISAAC near-infrared filter characteristics.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
or relating to the ISAAC near-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item CATCOL = INTEGER (Returned)

The column index of the standards catalogue
F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL//fs_izjhklm.dat> most appropriate for the filter.
The default is -1.

=item EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)

The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
default is 0.0.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ISAAC near-infrared photometry.

=item *

The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.

=item *

The recognised filters have names beginning Js, J, H, Ks, L,
SZ, and Z, as well as various narrow-band filters.  The latter
are assigned characteristics of their corresponding broadband
filter.

=item *

The mean extinction coefficients are: I<SZ>: 0.09, I<Z>: 0.08, I<J>:
0.11; i<Js>: 0.06; I<H>: 0.06; I<Ks>: 0.07; I<L>: 0.08; and I<NBM>:
0.30.  Zero extinction applies to any other filter.
