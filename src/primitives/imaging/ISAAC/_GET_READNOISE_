# Name:
#    _GET_READNOISE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the ISAAC readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
#    frame.  It first attempts to find a value for the calibration
#    system.  Where there is no value, the primitive assigns a
#    default, whose value depends on the camera.
#
#    The readnoise is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    READNOISE = REAL (Returned)
#       The readnoise obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for ISAAC in imaging mode.
#    -  The read noise comes from the readnoise calibration.
#    -  The default value 18.5e, unless the header INSMODE indicates
#    the long wavelength camera, whereupon the default is 27.

_GET_READNOISE_ -- Finds the ISAAC readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value for the calibration
system.  Where there is no value, the primitive assigns a
default, whose value depends on the camera.

The readnoise is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item READNOISE = REAL (Returned)

The readnoise obtained.

=item *

This primitive is only suitable for ISAAC in imaging mode.

=item *

The read noise comes from the readnoise calibration.

=item *

The default value 18.5e, unless the header INSMODE indicates
the long wavelength camera, whereupon the default is 27.
