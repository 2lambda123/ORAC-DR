# Name:
#    _DEFINE_DISTORTION_TRANSFORMATION_
#
# Purpose:
#    Creates the WCS mappings for ISAAC field-distortion correction.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive defines the field-distortion mapping for the
#    current frame, using the relationships stored in two `calibration'
#    files.  It creates a new WCS domain called ISAAC_DISTORTION within
#    the frame containing the forward and inverse distortion mappings.
#    It also replaces the original SKY domain which uses the incorrect,
#    distorted grid co-ordinates; it forms a compound mapping of the
#    grid distortion and the mapping between the undistorted grid and
#    ideal sky co-ordinates.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for ISAAC in imaging mode.
#    -  The distortion mapping comes from the ISAAC "Known Problems"
#    web page: http://www.eso.org/instruments/isaac/problems_tips.html.

This primitive defines the field-distortion mapping for the

the frame containing the forward and inverse distortion mappings.
It also replaces the original SKY domain which uses the incorrect,
distorted grid co-ordinates; it forms a compound mapping of the
grid distortion and the mapping between the undistorted grid and
ideal sky co-ordinates.
