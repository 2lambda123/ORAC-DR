=head1 NAME

_DIFFERENCE_PAIR_SIMPLE_ -- Subtracts pairs of frames and stores them in a new group.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive subtracts pairs of consecutive frames in a group.
The sense of the subtraction is defined by the steering header
PAIR_ORDER.  When PAIR_ORDER is true, the current frame is
subtracted from the previous frame, and vice versa.  In both cases,
the frame being subtracted from is designated the primary frame. 

The resultant difference frame becomes part of a group $diffGrp.
$diffGrp is created if it does not exist, and a reference to this
new group is recorded in the internal group header DIFFERENCE_GROUP.
Access to this group for further invocations is via DIFFERENCE_GROUP.

When argument DISPLACE is true, as needed for NOD recipes the
following additional steps are made.  The primitive evaluates
displacements in equatorial co-ordinates (arcsec) between the two 
frames and reports them; it records the displacements in the
difference frame as RA_OFFSET_DIFFERENCE and DEC_OFFSET_DIFFERENCE
internal headers.  The mean offsets of the pair replace those of the
primary header.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item DISPLACE = LOGICAL (Given)

When true (1), the equatorial displacements in arcsec between pairs
are recorded as RA_OFFSET_DIFFERENCE and DEC_OFFSET_DIFFERENCE
user headers in the difference frame, and reported.  The mean 
offsets of the pair replace those of the primary header.  [1]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for imaging infrared cameras.

=item *

The difference image can be displayed.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object, sky, or lamp frames when
the steering header DIFFERENCE_PAIR is true.

=item *

The offsets in each differenced-pair frame are the average
of the two frames, i.e. symmetric jittering is assumed.

=item *

The start airmass is propagated from the first frame and the
end airmass from the second frame.

=item *

The primary frame title is propagated to the differenced frame.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

Differenced pairs inheriting the primary frame's name but with
the _dp suffix.

=item *

Group of differenced frames via the DIFFERENCE_GROUP internal group
header.
