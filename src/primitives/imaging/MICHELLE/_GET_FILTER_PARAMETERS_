# Name:
#    _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Returns Michelle filter characteristics.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive using a switch structure to return five characteristics
#    or relating to the Michelle mid-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
#    Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.
#
#  Arguments:
#    EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)
#       The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
#       default is 0.18.
#    TOJANSKY = REAL (Returned)
#       The approximate conversion factor from magnitudes to jansky.
#       Some values, particularly for the narrow-band filters are
#       estimates.  The default is 37.2.
#    WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Returned)
#       The single-character name of the waveband (NQ) within the
#       catalogue of standards most appropriate for the current frame's
#       filter.  If the filter is not recognised, WAVEBAND returns " ".
#    WIDTH = REAL (Returned)
#       Filter width in microns.  The default is 1.0.
#    ZEROPOINT = REAL (Returned)
#       Zero point to apply to instrumental magnitudes before
#       conversion to jansky.  The default is 12.89.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for Michelle in imaging mode.
#    -  The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.
#    -  The recognised filters are 79B10, 88B10, 97B10, 103B10,
#    105B53, 107B4, 116B9, 122B3, 125B9, 128B2, F185B9, and F209B42.

=head1 NAME

_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_ -- Returns Michelle filter characteristics.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive using a switch structure to return five characteristics
or relating to the Michelle mid-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)

The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
default is 0.18.

=item TOJANSKY = REAL (Returned)

The approximate conversion factor from magnitudes to jansky.
Some values, particularly for the narrow-band filters are estimates.
The default is 37.2.

=item WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Returned)

The single-character name of the waveband (I<NQ>) within the
catalogue of standards most appropriate for the current frame's
filter.  If the filter is not recognised, WAVEBAND returns " ".

=item WIDTH = REAL (Returned)

Filter width in microns.  The default is 1.0.

=item ZEROPOINT = REAL (Returned)

Zero point to apply to instrumental magnitudes before
conversion to jansky.  The default is 12.89.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.

=item *

The recognised filters are 79B10, 88B10, 97B10, 103B10,
105B53, 107B4, 116B9, 122B3, 125B9, 128B2, F185B9, and F209B42.
