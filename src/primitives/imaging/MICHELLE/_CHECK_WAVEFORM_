# Name:
#    _CHECK_WAVEFORM_
#
# Purpose:
#    Provide a sanity check by comparing the waveform name given
#    in the header with other information in the header, then
#    report if there is an inconsistency.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This recipe compares the waveform name in the header with
#    filter names and observation modes to ensure the correct
#    waveform is being used for the given observation. If an
#    incorrect waveform is used, a warning will be issued.
#
# Notes:
#    - If the filter name is either "I105B53" or "I209B43",
#      then the waveform must be "starev13big", otherwise
#      the waveform must be "stare11big".
#
#    - If polarimetry is done, no check is performed.
#
#    - Waveform header is in the internal header "WAVEFORM".

=head1 NAME

_CHECK_WAVEFORM_ - Provide a sanity check by comparing the waveform
name in the header with other information in the header, then report
if there is an inconsistency.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe compares the waveform name in the header with filter
names and observation modes to ensure the correct waveform is being
used for the given observation. If an incorrect waveform is used,
a warning will be issued.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

If the filter name is either "I105B53" or "I209B43", then the
waveform must be "starev13big", otherwise the waveform must be
"stare11big".

=item *

If polarimetry is done, no check is performed.

=item *

Waveform header is in the internal header "WAVEFORM".
