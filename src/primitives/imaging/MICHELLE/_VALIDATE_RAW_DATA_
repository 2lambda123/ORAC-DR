# Name:
#    _VALIDATE_RAW_DATA_
#
# Purpose:
#    Tests the validity of the raw data, such as count rates.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive determines a representative mean count from the
#    central 100x100-pixel square of the raw data in each beam, and
#    reports the value to optimise signal to noise.  A warning is
#    issued if the value is less than 25000 or exceeds 48000 counts.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for Michelle in imaging mode.
