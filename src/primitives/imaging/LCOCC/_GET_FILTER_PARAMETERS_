# Name:
#    _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Returns LCOGT optical filter characteristics.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
#    or relating to the LCOGT optical imaging filters through arguments.
#    Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.
#
#  Arguments:
#    EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)
#       The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
#       default is 0.0.
#    WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Returned)
#       The name of the waveband (U, B, V, R, I) within the
#       catalogue of standards most appropriate for the current frame's
#       filter.  If the filter is not recognised, WAVEBAND returns " ".
#    WAVELENGTH = REAL (Returned)
#       The central wavelength of the waveband returned by the WAVEBAND
#       argument, in microns.  If the filter is not recognised, WAVELENGTH
#       returns 0.0.
#    M1INSTZP = REAL (Returned)
#       The M1 instrumental zeropoint of the waveband returned by the WAVEBAND
#       argument, in magnitudes that gives 1 e-/pixel/sec.  If the filter is 
#     	not recognised, M1INSTZP returns 0.0.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for LCOGT optical photometry.
#    -  The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.
#    -  The recognised filters have names ending with U, B, V, R, I, 
#     	up, gp, rp, ip, zp, zs and Y.
#    -  The mean extinction coefficients are: U: 0.53; B: 0.27; V: 0.14;
#    R: 0.10; I: 0.05; up: 0.56; gp: 0.20; rp:0.11; ip: 0.05; zp: 0.04 
#    and Y: 0.03.  Zero extinction applies to any other filter.
#    Effective wavelengths are from Bessell (1998); extinction is from
#    AJP's loc_m1_assm.c code as of 2012/05/08 for ELP; M1 inst. zeropoints are 
#    from AJP's loc_m1_assm.c code as of 2012/05/08 for 1m0 kb22.

_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_ -- Returns LCOGT optical filter characteristics.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
or relating to the LCOGT optical imaging filters through arguments.
Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)

The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
default is 0.0.

=item WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Returned)

The name of the waveband (I<U, B, V, R, I>) within the
catalogue of standards most appropriate for the current frame's
filter.  If the filter is not recognised, WAVEBAND returns " ".

=item WAVELENGTH = REAL (Returned)

The central wavelength of the waveband returned by the WAVEBAND
argument, in microns. If the filter is not recognised, WAVELENGTH
returns 0.0.

=item M1INSTZP = REAL (Returned)

The M1 instrumental zeropoint for the waveband returned by the WAVEBAND
argument, in magnitudes that gives 1 e-/pixel/sec.  If the filter is 
not recognised, M1INSTZP returns 0.0.

=item *

This primitive is suitable for LCOGT optical photometry.

=item *

The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.

=item *

The recognised filters have names ending with U, B, V, R, I, up, gp, rp, ip, zp,
zs and Y.

The mean extinction coefficients are: I<U>: 0.53, I<B>: 0.27, I<V>: 0.14,
I<R>: 0.10, I<I>: 0.05, I<u'>: 0.56, I<g'>: 0.20, I<r'>:0.11, I<i'>: 0.05, 
I<z'>: 0.04 and I<Y>: 0.03.  Zero extinction applies to any other filter.
Effective wavelengths are from Bessell (1998); extinction is from
AJP's loc_m1_assm.c code as of 2012/05/08 for ELP; M1 inst. zeropoints are 
from AJP's loc_m1_assm.c code as of 2012/06/06 for 1m0 kb22.
