# Name:
#    _REMOVE_TITLE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Removes any NDF titles from the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive erases any NDF title within each integration in the
#    current Frame.  This is needed after the raw data format changed in
#    2002 March.  Prior to that date the raw data contained no title.
#    Since then it has a blank title.  This change could result in the
#    loss of the OBJECT name when a processed NDF is converted to FITS,
#    as the title takes precedence over the OBJECT keyword.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: SETTITLE.
