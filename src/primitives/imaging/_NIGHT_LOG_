# Name:
#    _NIGHT_LOG_

# Purpose:
#    Produces a text file log of a night's imaging observations.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe takes a night's imaging observations, and creates a text
#    file containing a headed tabulation of parameters for each frame. 
#
#    The parameters are: observation number, group number, object name,
#    observation type, UT start time, exposure time, number of coadds,
#    read mode and speed, filter, start airmass, frame dimensions in
#    pixels, base equatorial co-ordinates, and data-reduction recipe name.
# 
# Arguments:
#    OUT = LOGICAL (Given)
#       When set (to any value) the log file is written to ORAC_DATA_OUT
#       rather than to ORAC_DATA_IN.
#
# Notes:
#    -  The <date> comes from the internal header keyword ORAC_UTDATE. 
#    -  The logfile created by this primitive does not follow the standard
#    ORAC-DR naming convention (log.xxxx) since it can be used to write
#    log files to directories other than $ORAC_DATA_OUT and unique file
#    names are required.
#    -  Fudges missing or old headers.
#    -  Uses user header ORAC_INSTRUMENT to specify the file name.
#    -  Specification provided by Sandy Leggett.

# Output Data:
#    -  For UFTI and IRCAM the text log file $ORAC_DATA_IN/<date>.nightlog,
#    where <date> is the UT date, unless the OUT argument is set,
#    whereupon the log is in $ORAC_DATA_OUT.  This enables a separate
#    on-the-fly log.  For the multi-mode instruments UIST, Michelle,
#    IRIS2, and ISAAC the file is $ORAC_DATA_IN/<date>_im.nightlog.
#
#    The on-the-fly log in $ORAC_DATA_OUT is always appended to, being
#    created only if it doesn't exist.  Thus multiple entries for the
#    same observation may exist in the on-the-fly log if the pipeline is
#    rerun.
#
#    The "clean" log file in $ORAC_DATA_IN is re-started if the observation
#    number equals 1 and is appended to otherwise, being created as necessary.

=item *

The text log file F<$ORAC_DATA_IN/E<lt>dateE<lt>.nightlog>, where
E<lt>dateE<gt> is the UT date, unless the OUT argument is set,
whereupon the log is in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT>.  This enables a separate
on-the-fly log.  For the multi-mode instruments UIST, Michelle, IRIS2,

The on-the-fly log in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT> is always appended to, being
created only if it doesn't exist.  Thus multiple entries for the same
observation may exist in the on-the-fly log if the pipeline is rerun.

The "clean" log file in F$<ORAC_DATA_IN> is re-started if the observation
number equals 1 and is appended to otherwise, being created as necessary.
