_FILE_MASK_ -- Files a frame as the current bad-pixel mask.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This generic primitive files the current frame as the current
bad-pixel mask. It also adds the bad-pixel mask to the index of
bad-pixel mask frames.  Both steps are reported.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

Frame bpm_I<n>, where I<n> is the original frame number, is a copy of
the supplied frame, but only if the name of the current
frame does not already begin "bpm_".
