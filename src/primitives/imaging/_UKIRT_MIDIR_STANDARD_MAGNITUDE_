# Name:
#    _UKIRT_MIDIR_STANDARD_MAGNITUDE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Obtains the catalogue magnitude of a UKIRT mid-infrared standard.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive reads the UKIRT mid-infrared-standard catalogue.
#    A case- and space-insensitive comparison of the supplied object
#    name with the entries in the table provides a catalogue magnitude
#    in N or Q for a standard star.  The catalogue magnitude is returned
#    through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    CATMAG = REAL (Returned)
#       The catalogue magnitude for the object and current frame's filter.
#       This is set to the NULLMAG if no magnitude is available.
#    CATNAME = CHARACTER (Returned)
#       The object name in the catalogue.  This has superfluous
#       characters removed from the supplied NAME.
#    NAME = CHARACTER (Given).
#       The object name.  This can be Bright Star Catalogue number, or
#       the alternative Bayer name.
#    NULLMAG = REAL (Given)
#       A null magnitude when the object has no magnitude for the filter.
#       [99.999]
#    WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The name of the waveband.  It may be N or Q.  It comes from
#       _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_.  ["N"]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for mid-infra-red imagers.
#    -  Processing should only occur when it is time to perform
#    photometry, i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true,
#    however, this primitive does not make that check.  That is to
#    permit photometry of all the contributing frames of a mosaic.
#    -  An error occurs when the waveband is not N or Q.
#    -  The standard-star catalogue used is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/10_20stds.dat.
#    An error results a catalogue cannot be opened.

=item *

This primitive is suitable for mid-infrared imagers.

=item *
