# Name:
#    _ARRAY_TEST_STATISTICS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Determines the state of the IRCAM detector for the ARRAY_TESTS
#    recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive evaluates the STARE and ND_STARE readout noises in
#    electrons and the dark current in electrons per second for IRCAM.
#    The script also reports these statistics, indicating whether or 
#    not they are nominal.  At UKIRT, the results are also logged to a
#    text file, /ukirt_sw/logs/ircam3_array_tests.log, to monitor
#    secular trends.
#
#    The primitive expects sets of eight frames.  In each set the first
#    refresh frame is ignored, then come two STARE and two ND_STARE-mode
#    frames all of one-second duration, followed by a long (60s)
#    STARE-mode dark, an ignored refresh frame, and another one-second
#    STARE dark.
#
# Notes:
#    -  The exposure times used to normalise the dark current to
#    electrons per second comes from the ORAC_EXPOSURE_TIME header in
#    the sixth and eighth frames, defaulting to 60 and 1 second
#    respectively if the associated header is undefined.  The ADU comes
#    from the user header ORAC_GAIN header, defaulting to 6.0 if the
#    header is undefined.
#    -  If the log file does not exist, a new one is created containing
#    a two-line heading, and the fact is reported.
#    -  The log file stores the results in a fixed columnar format.
#    -  The STARE noise is the standard deviation per frame of the
#    second and third frames subtracted, and converted from counts to
#    electrons.  ND_STARE is calculated in the same fashion for the
#    fourth and fifth frames.
#    -  The dark current is the median of the dark count normalised to
#    unit time and converted to electrons.
#    -  The nominal STARE and ND_STARE readout noises are 56 and 38
#    electrons respectively, and the nominal dark current is 0 to 5
#    electron per second.
#
# Deficiencies:
#    -  There is no validation of the frame types.
#    -  Hardwired ADU and exposure times.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: HISTAT, STATS, SUB.

=head1 NAME

_ARRAY_TEST_STATISTICS_ -- Determines the state of the IRCAM detector for the ARRAY_TESTS recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive evaluates the STARE and ND_STARE readout noises in
electrons and the dark current in electrons per second for IRCAM.
The script also reports these statistics, indicating whether or 
not they are nominal.  At UKIRT, the results are also logged to a
text file, F</ukirt_sw/logs/ircam3_array_tests.log>, to monitor
secular trends.

The primitive expects sets of eight frames.  In each set the first
refresh frame is ignored, then come two STARE and two ND_STARE-mode
frames all of one-second duration, followed by a long (60s)
STARE-mode dark, an ignored refresh frame, and another one-second
STARE dark.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The exposure times used to normalise the dark current to electrons per
second comes from the ORAC_EXPOSURE_TIME header in the sixth and
eighth frames, defaulting to 60 and 1 second respectively if the
associated header is undefined.  The ADU comes from the user header
ORAC_GAIN header, defaulting to 6.0 if the header is undefined.

=item *

If the log file does not exist, a new one is created containing
a two-line heading, and the fact is reported.

=item *

The log file stores the results in a fixed columnar format.

=item *

The STARE noise is the standard deviation per frame of the
second and third frames subtracted, and converted from counts to
electrons.  ND_STARE is calculated in the same fashion for the
fourth and fifth frames.

=item *

The dark current is the median of the dark count normalised to
unit time and converted to electrons.

=item *

The nominal STARE and ND_STARE readout noises are 56 and 38
electrons respectively, and the nominal dark current is 0 to 5
electron per second.

=head1 DEFICIENCIES

=over 4

=item *

There is no validation of the frame types.

=item *

Hardwired ADU and exposure times.
