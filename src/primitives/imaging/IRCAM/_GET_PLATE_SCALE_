# Name:
#    _GET_PLATE_SCALE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the pixel scales measured in arcseconds per pixel for the
#    current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the pixel increments from the headers of the
#    current frame, and if necessary, converts them to arcseconds per
#    pixel.  This allows ORAC_RA_SCALE and ORAC_DEC_SCALE internal
#    headers to be used either in a World Co-ordinate System or be
#    combined to derive the pixel scale.  The scales are returned
#    in three arguments.
#
# Arguments:
#    DECSCALE = REAL (Returned)
#       The increment along the declination axis of the current 
#       frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.  This may be negative.
#    PLATESCALE = REAL (Returned)
#       The geometric-mean plate scale, i.e. the average of the absolute
#       values of DECSCALE and RASCALE.
#    RASCALE = REAL (Returned)
#       The increment along the right-ascension axis of the current 
#       frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.  This may be negative.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  The platescale internal headers are ORAC_RA_SCALE and
#    ORAC_DEC_SCALE.  Header CTYPE1 set to 'RA---TAN' indicates the presence
#    of the AIPS-convention WCS.

=head1 NAME

_GET_PLATE_SCALE_ -- Finds the pixel scales measured in arcseconds per pixel for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the pixel increments from the headers of the
current frame, and if necessary, converts them to arcseconds per
pixel.  This allows ORAC_RA_SCALE and ORAC_DEC_SCALE internal
headers to be used either in a World Co-ordinate System or be
combined to derive the pixel scale.  The scales are returned
in three arguments.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item DECSCALE = REAL (Returned)

The increment along the declination axis of the current 
frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.  This may be negative.

=item PLATESCALE = REAL (Returned)

The geometric-mean plate scale, i.e. the average of the absolute values
of DECSCALE and RASCALE.

=item RASCALE = REAL (Returned)

The increment along the right-ascension axis of the current 
frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.  This may be negative.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is only suitable for IRCAM.

=item 4

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.

=item *

The platescale internal headers are ORAC_RA_SCALE and ORAC_DEC_SCALE.
Header CTYPE1 set to 'RA---TAN' indicates the presence of the
AIPS-convention WCS.
