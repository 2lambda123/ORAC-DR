# Purpose:
#    Finds the IRCAM saturation level in ADU the current Frame.

# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the IRCAM saturation level in ADU for the current

#    The saturation level is returned through an argument.

# Arguments:
#    SATURATION = REAL (Returned)
#       The saturation level obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for IRCAM.
#    -  It merely uses a constants depending upon the speed/gain
#    obtained from user header ORAC_SPEED_GAIN.
#    -  The values are taken from the instrument's Web page, viz.
