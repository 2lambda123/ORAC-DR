# Name:
#    _INSTRUMENT_HELLO_
#
# Purpose:
#    Performs the instrument-specific imaging setup.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive is performs the instrument specific setup for
#    imaging.  It's needed for the generic _IMAGING_HELLO_.  In this
#    case it allows for a missing detector speed gain, and reports
#    that the set-up operations are complete.
#
#  Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for IRCAM.
#    -  It sets the user header ORAC_SPEED_GAIN and adds a card before
#    the DEPERDN keyword to the FITS headers.
#    -  The gain is "Standard" for a detector bias (from user header
#    ORAC_DETECTOR_BIAS) for a bias of 0.62 volts, or "Deepwell"
#    otherwise.

# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: FITSMOD.

_INSTRUMENT_HELLO_ -- Performs the instrument-specific imaging setup.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive is performs the instrument specific setup for
imaging.  It's needed for the generic L<_IMAGING_HELLO_|_IMAGING_HELLO_>.
In this case it allows for a missing detector speed gain, and reports
that the set-up operations are complete.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for IRCAM.

=item *

It sets the user header ORAC_SPEED_GAIN and adds a card before
the DEPERDN keyword to the FITS headers.

=item *

The gain is "Standard" for a detector bias (from user header
ORAC_DETECTOR_BIAS) for a bias of 0.62 volts, or "Deepwell"
otherwise.
