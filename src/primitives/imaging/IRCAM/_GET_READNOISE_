# Name:
#    _GET_READNOISE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the IRCAM readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
#    frame.  It first attempts to find a value for the calibration
#    system.  Where there is no value or suitable value with matching
#    attributes such as read type, speed and gain, the primitive assigns
#    default values using those attributes.
#
#    The readnoise is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    READNOISE = REAL (Returned)
#       The readnoise obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for IRCAM.
#    -  The read type comes from user header ORAC_DETECTOR_READ_TYPE,
#    and the speed/gain from ORAC_SPEED_GAIN.
#    -  The defaults are taken from the instrument's Web page.

=head1 NAME

_GET_READNOISE_ -- Finds the IRCAM readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value for the calibration system.
Where there is no value or suitable value with matching attributes
such as read type, speed and gain, the primitive assigns default
values using those attributes.

The readnoise is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=item READNOISE = REAL (Returned)

The readnoise obtained.

=item *

This primitive is only suitable for IRCAM.

=item *

The read type comes from user header ORAC_DETECTOR_READ_TYPE, and
the speed/gain from ORAC_SPEED_GAIN.
