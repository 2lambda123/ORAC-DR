# Name:
#    _CREATE_RAW_FRAME_
#
# Purpose:
#    Creates a raw frame in ORAC_DATA_OUT.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive copies the raw data frame into ORAC_DATA_OUT where
#    it may be edited.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for IRCAM.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Copied frame inheriting the current frame's name but with
#    the _cl suffix.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: NDFCOPY.

# IRCAM raw data are in the same directory as the reduced data, and are
# protected against all but read access.  Thus to switch on history
# recording and set the origin we have to work on an output copy of the
# array.  Some headers have incorrect names for IRCAM, so can't test for
# it directly.

# Generate list of input and output filenames.
    my ( $in, $out ) = $Frm->inout( "_cl" );

# Copy the data.
    $Mon{ "ndfpack_mon" }->obeyw( "ndfcopy", "in=$in out=$out" );

# Report the processing status.
    orac_print "$in to $out: Copied NDF component.\n";

# Now update the output filename in the Frame object.
    $Frm->file( $out );
