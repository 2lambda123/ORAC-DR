# Name:
#    _MASK_OBJECTS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Masks objects with bad pixels.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive applies an ARD mask to the current frame.  The
#    supplied ARD file should define a series elliptical regions
#    which cover sources within the frame (cf. _MAKE_OBJECTS_MASK_).
#    The masked pixels are specified by Starlink bad (`magic') values.
#    The primitive reports a successful masking and the frames
#    concerned.
#
# Arguments:
#    MASKFILE = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The name of the ARD (ASCII Region Definition cf. SUN/183)
#       text file containing the regions spanning the objecxts in the
#       frame.  It defaults to the "<frame>_objects.ard", where
#       <frame> is the name of the frame.  []
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when
#    the mask file exists.  Should the file not exist, the input
#    frame is copied.
#    -  The masked image can be displayed.
#    -  The frame title is "Objects masked".
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Masked frame inheriting the current frame's name but with the
#    _om suffix.

# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: ARDMASK, NDFCOPY.

=head1 NAME

_MASK_OBJECTS_ -- Masks objects with bad pixels.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive applies an ARD mask to the current frame.  The supplied
ARD file should define a series elliptical regions which cover sources
within the frame (cf. L<_MAKE_OBJECTS_MASK_|_MAKE_OBJECTS_MASK_>).  The
masked pixels are specified by Starlink bad (`magic') values.  The
primitive reports a successful masking and the frames concerned.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item MASKFILE = CHARACTER (Given)

The name of the ARD (ASCII Region Definition cf. SUN/183)
text file containing the regions spanning the objecxts in the
frame.  It defaults to the "E<lt>frameE<gt>_objects.ard", where
E<lt>frameE<gt> is the name of the frame.  []

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when
the mask file exists.  Should the file not exist, the input
frame is copied.

=item *

The masked image can be displayed.

=item *

The frame title is "Objects masked".


=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

Masked frame inheriting the current frame's name but with the _om suffix.
