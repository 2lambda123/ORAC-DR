# Name:
#    _MAKE_FLAT_CHOP_SKY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Makes a flat from the sky frames for a CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive processes sky frames in the current $Grp of a
#    CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipe, to make a flat field.  It normalises the
#    sky frames to each other, and combines the frames using the median
#    at each pixel.  The resultant frame is normalised (to 1) to make
#    the flat.  The flat is indexed.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for the SOFI infra-red instrument in
#    imaging mode.
#    -  This primitive is suitable for the SOFI infra-red imager.
#    -  Processing only occurs when the steering header TARGET_OR_SKY
#    is "sky", and when the flat has not be specified already.
#    -  The work is done by _NORMALISE_TO_MODE_EXTENDED_,
#    and _MAKE_FLAT_FROM_NORMALISED_CHOP_SKY_ primitives.
#    -  Stores the template name before normalisation, so that it can
#    be reset at the end, for determining sky levels.
#    -  There is no deviants masking because this also filters out the
#    cusp from bias variations between the upper and lower halves
#    of the detector.
#
# Output Data:
#    None.  However, the invoked primitives do create new frames.  The
#    bottom line is that a flat field frame is filed and indexed.
#    Various intermediate frames are normally removed by a tidy primitive.

=head1 NAME

_MAKE_FLAT_CHOP_SKY_ -- Makes a flat from the sky frames for a CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive processes sky frames in the current $Grp of a
CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipe, to make a flat field.  It normalises the sky
frames to each other, and combines the frames using the median at each
pixel.  The resultant frame is normalised (to 1) to make the flat.
The flat is indexed.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for the SOFI infra-red instrument in
imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs when the steering header TARGET_OR_SKY is "sky",
and when the flat has not be specified already.

=item *

The work is done by L<_MASK_DEVIANTS_|_MASK_DEVIANTS_>,
L<_NORMALISE_TO_MODE_EXTENDED_|_NORMALISE_TO_MODE_EXTENDED_>, and
L<_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_NORMALISED_CHOP_SKY_|_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_NORMALISED_CHOP_SKY_>
primitives.

=item *

Stores the template name before normalisation, so that it can
be reset at the end, for determining sky levels.

=item *

There is no deviants masking because this also filters out the
cusp from bias variations between the upper and lower halves
of the detector.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.  However, the invoked primitives do create new frames.  The
bottom line is that a flat field frame is filed and indexed.
Various intermediate frames are normally removed by a tidy primitive.
