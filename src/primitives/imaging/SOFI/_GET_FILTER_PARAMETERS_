# Name:
#    _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Returns SOFI near-infrared filter characteristics.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
#    or relating to the SOFI near-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
#    Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.
#
#  Arguments:
#    EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)
#       The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
#       default is 0.0.
#    WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Returned)
#       The name of the waveband (Z, J, H, K) within the catalogue of standards
#       most appropriate for the current frame's filter.  If the filter is not
#       recognised, WAVEBAND returns " ".
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for SOFI near-infrared photometry.
#    -  The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.
#    -  The recognised filters have names beginning J, H, K, and Z, as well as
#    various narrow-band filters with names beginning "NB_".  The latter
#    are assigned characteristics of their corresponding broadband
#    filter.
#    -  The mean extinction coefficients are: Z: 0.08, J: 0.11; NB J: 0.06;
#    H: 0.06; and K: 0.07.  Zero extinction applies to any other filter.
#    These values are for Paranal, nort la Silla, so are even less
#    accurate than normal.

=head1 NAME

_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_ -- Returns SOFI near-infrared filter characteristics.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
or relating to the SOFI near-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)

The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
default is 0.0.

=item WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Returned)

The name of the waveband (Z, J, H, K) within the catalogue of standards
most appropriate for the current frame's filter.  If the filter is not
recognised, WAVEBAND returns " ".

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for SOFI near-infrared photometry.

=item *

The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.

=item *

The recognised filters have names beginning J, H, K, and Z, as well as
various narrow-band filters with names beginning "NB_".  The latter
are assigned characteristics of their corresponding broadband
filter.

=item *

The mean extinction coefficients are: I<Z>: 0.08, I<J>: 0.11; NB_i<J>:
0.06; I<H>: 0.06; I<K>: 0.07. Zero extinction applies to any other filter.
These values are for Paranal, nort la Silla, so are even less
accurate than normal.
