# Name:
#    _GET_READNOISE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the SOFI readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
#    frame.  It first attempts to find a value for the calibration
#    system.  Where there is no value, the primitive assigns a
#    default, whose value depends on the camera.
#
#    The readnoise is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    READNOISE = REAL (Returned)
#       The readnoise obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for SOFI in imaging mode.
#    -  The read noise comes from the readnoise calibration.
#    -  The default value is 11.4e (2.1ADU).

_GET_READNOISE_ -- Finds the SOFI readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value for the calibration
system.  Where there is no value, the primitive assigns a
default, whose value depends on the camera.

The readnoise is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=item READNOISE = REAL (Returned)

The readnoise obtained.

=item *

The read noise comes from the readnoise calibration.
