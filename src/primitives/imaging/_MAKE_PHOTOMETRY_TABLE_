# Name:
#    _MAKE_PHOTOMETRY_TABLE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Creates an STL file for recording aperture photometry results.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive creates a Starlink small text-file (STL) catalogue.
#    It contains the headers for the tabulated data made by primitive
#    _FIXED_APERTURE_PHOTOMETRY_.  In addition to the regular headers
#    there is a formatted comment line immediately before the
#    BEGINTABLE presenting the column headings.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  On exit the STL file is closed.
#
# Arguments:
#    FILE = CHARACTER (Read)
#       Name of the STL text file to create in ORAC_DATA_OUT.
#       ["aphot_results.txt"]
