# Name:
#    _REMOVE_COLUMN_ROW_STRUCTURE_SCAN_
#
# Purpose:
#    Removes column and row structure from mosaics created
#    from a scan recipe for Michelle.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive is a wrapper for _REMOVE_COLUMN_ROW_STRUCTURE_,
#    which is used to remove column and row structure from
#    images. This primitive is meant to be used for Michelle
#    data taken with the NOD_CHOP_SCAN recipe.
#
# Notes:
#    - Processing only occurs when the steering header
#    MAKE_MOSAIC is true, and if the header SCAN_INDEX
#    is defined.
