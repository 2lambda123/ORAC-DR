# Name:
#    _REMOVE_AXES_
#
# Purpose:
#    Removes any AXIS data structure in the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive erases any AXIS structure within each integration
#    in the current Frame.  This is needed after the raw data format
#    changed in 2002 March.  Prior to that date the raw data contained
#    no axis structure.  Later primitives assumed that NDF sections
#    with floating-point values were in pixel co-ordinates not axis
#    co-ordinates.  The raw data axis co-ordinates were effectively
#    GRID co-ordinates and give erroneous results for sub-arrays.
#
# Notes:
#    - This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle and
#    UIST in imaging mode.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: SETAXIS.

This primitive erases any AXIS structure within each integration
in the current Frame.  This is needed after the raw data format
changed in 2002 March.  Prior to that date the raw data contained
no axis structure.  Later primitives assumed that NDF sections
with floating-point values were in pixel co-ordinates not axis
co-ordinates.  The raw data axis co-ordinates were effectively
GRID co-ordinates and give erroneous results for sub-arrays.
