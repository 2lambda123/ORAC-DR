# Name:
#    _NOD_APHOT_MAG_
#
# Purpose:
#    Performs aperture photometry for NOD recipes using UFTI.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive computes photometry for the individual frames and
#    mosaic of a NOD jitter.  It invokes _FIXED_APERTURE_PHOTOMETRY_
#    to derive aperture photometry for both the positive and negative
#    point sources.  Photometry is performed for each frame of the
#    current cycle in the difference group, and the group mosaic frame.
#
#  Arguments:
#     APERTURE = REAL (Given)
#        The aperture in arcseconds for the photometry.  [5.0]
#     INNER = REAL (Given)
#        The ratio of the diameters of inner ring of the sky annulus to
#        that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained
#        to be in the range 1.1 to 3.0.  The mode of the pixel values in 
#        the annulus is used to subtract the sky for statistics 3) and
#        4) listed above.  [1.3]
#     SKY_EST = INTEGER (Given)
#        Sky estimations method as per AUTOPHOTOM parameter SKYEST.  The
#        default is the mode, so as to exclude contaminating sources.
#        1 is the mean; 2 is the average of values within two standard
#        deviations of the mean; 3 is the mode from PHOTOM, 4 is a 
#        multiply clipped mean emulating the mode but without involving
#        the median.  It is supplied as a constant to AUTOPHOTOM (hence
#        option 4).  The final option is to cope with self-flat frames
#        with a spike artifact in the histogram thus giving the wrong
#        median, and hence biased mode.  The default is used should 
#        the supplied value not be one of the allowed options. [4]
#     OUTER = REAL (Given)
#        The ratio of the diameters of outer ring of the sky annulus to
#        that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained to
#        be in the range 1.4 to 5.0 and be at least 0.3 greater than the
#        inner scale factor of the annulus.  [2.5]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for UFTI.
#    -  Processing only occurs when it is time to perform photometry,
#    i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true, and only on object
#    frames.
#    -  The steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the recipe cycle
#    number.
#    -  The reference to the difference group is stored in the internal
#    group header DIFFERENCE_GROUP.
#    -  To discriminate between the various results, in the results
#    file the positive images have suffix "_pos" after the frame name
#    and the negative images have a "_neg" suffix.
#    -  The primitive sets the telescope offsets of the mosaic to be zero
#    both in the physical frame and in the group header.  It then finds
#    the displacements of the positive and negative images about the centre
#    of each frame.  The displacements are half of the reference (first)
#    frame's internal headers XOFFSET_DIFFERENCE and YOFFSET_DIFFERENCE.

=item *

This primitive is only suitable for UFTI.

=item *

Processing only occurs when it is time to perform photometry,
i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true, and only on object
frames.

=item *

The steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the recipe cycle
number.

=item *

The reference to the difference group is stored in the internal
group header DIFFERENCE_GROUP.

=item *

To discriminate between the various results, in the results
file the positive images have suffix "_pos" after the frame name
and the negative images have a "_neg" suffix.

=item *

The primitive sets the telescope offsets of the mosaic to be zero
both in the physical frame and in the group header.  It then finds
the displacements of the positive and negative images about the centre
of each frame.  The displacements are half of the reference (first)
frame's internal headers XOFFSET_DIFFERENCE and YOFFSET_DIFFERENCE.
