# Name:
#    _SCALE_FP_
#
# Purpose:
#    Applies scalings to the various components of an Fabry-Perot observation.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive calibrates Fabry-Perot data by scaling.  Different
#    scaling can be applied to any or all of the following
#    components: the line, the positive or negative continuum.
#
#    The continuum frames always have their signs changed too, in
#    addition to any other scaling given by the POSITIVE and NEGATIVE
#    arguments.
#
# Arguments:
#    LINE = REAL
#       The scaling to apply to the source signal.  The value is
#       constrained to the range 0.1 to 10.0.  [1.0]
#    NEGATIVE = REAL
#       The scaling to apply to the negative-offset continuum signal.  The
#       value is constrained to the range 0.1 to 10.0.  One of either
#       POSITIVE or NEGATIVE should be 1.0.  [1.0]
#    POSITIVE = REAL
#       The scaling to apply to the positive-offset continuum signal.  The
#       value is constrained to the range 0.1 to 10.0.  One of either
#       POSITIVE or NEGATIVE should be 1.0.  [1.0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI.
#    -  It should only be invoked after _DIFFERENCE_PAIRS_ or equivalent
#    has subtracted the off-source frame from the on-source frame.
#    -  Processing only occurs when the steering header FLAT_DIVIDE is
#    true.
#    -  The cycle number is given by steering header CYCLE_NUMBER.
#    -  The line scaling only occurs if its scaling factor is not 1.0.
#    - A warning is issued if both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE are not
#    1.0.
#    -  The line data consist of two frames.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Scaled frames each inheriting the primary frame's name but with
#    the _fps suffix.  There will always be continuum frames created,
#    but the line frame is only formed when argument LINE is not 1.0.
