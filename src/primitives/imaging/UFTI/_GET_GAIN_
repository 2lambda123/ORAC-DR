# Name:
#    _GET_GAIN_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the UFTI gain in electrons per ADU for the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the gain in electrons per ADU for the current
#    frame.  It first attempts to find a value from the header.  If this
#    is null or less than 1.0, the primitive uses a default value based
#    upon the time of observation, and it reports the use of the default.
#
#    The gain is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    GAIN = REAL (Returned)
#       The gain obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for UFTI.
#    -  The gain comes from the user header ORAC_GAIN header.  The default
#    value is 7.0 for data taken before 2001 February 27, and 5.798 otherwise.
#    -  The defaults are taken from the instrument's Web page, viz.
#    http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/UKIRT/instruments/ufti/PARAMETERS.html.

=head1 NAME

_GET_GAIN_ -- Finds the UFTI gain in electrons per ADU for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the gain in electrons per ADU for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value from the header.  If this
is null or less than 1.0, the primitive uses a default value based
upon the time of observation, and it reports the use of the default.

The gain is returned through an argument.

=item GAIN = REAL (Returned)

The gain obtained.

=item *

This primitive is only suitable for UFTI.

=item *

The gain comes from the user header ORAC_GAIN header.  The default
value is 7.0 for data taken before 2001 February 27, and 5.798 otherwise.
