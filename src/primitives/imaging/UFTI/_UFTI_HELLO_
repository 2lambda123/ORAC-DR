# Name:
#    _UFTI_HELLO_
#
# Purpose:
#    Performs global data-reduction tasks for UFTI.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive does the preparatory work for recipes used by UFTI.
#    It permits display of the raw data, sets the pixel origin, and
#    switches on history recording.
#
# Notes:
#    -  The readout lower bounds in the frame user headers
#    ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND and ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND define the pixel origin. 
#    No origin is set if these do not exist, as happens in wavefront
#    sensing.

=head1 NAME

_UFTI_HELLO_ -- Performs global data-reduction tasks for UFTI.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive does the preparatory work for recipes used by UFTI.
It permits display of the raw data, sets the pixel origin, and
switches on history recording.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The readout lower bounds in the frame user headers ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND
and ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND define the pixel origin.  No origin is set if
these do not exist, as happens in wavefront sensing.

=head1 TASKS
