# Name:
#    _UKIRT_STANDARD_MAGNITUDE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Obtains the catalogue magnitude of a UKIRT standard.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive reads the faint-standard catalogue or its
#    predecessor.  A case- and space-insensitive comparison of the
#    supplied object name with the entries in the table provides a
#    catalogue magnitude in I, Z, Y, J, H, K, L, or M for a
#    standard star.  The catalogue magnitude is returned through an
#    argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    CATMAG = REAL (Returned)
#       The catalogue magnitude for the object and current frame's filter.
#       This is set to the NULLMAG if no magnitude is available.
#    CATNAME = CHARACTER (Returned)
#       The object name in the catalogue.  This has superfluous
#       characters removed from the supplied NAME.
#    NAME = CHARACTER (Given).
#       The object name.  This can be UKIRT Faint Standard catalogue
#       number, or the alternative name.
#    NULLMAG = REAL (Given)
#       A null magnitude when the object has no magnitude for the filter.
#       [99.999]
#    WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The name of the waveband.  It may be I, Z, Y, J, H, K, L, or M.
#       It comes from _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UKIRT near-infra-red imagers.
#    -  Processing should only occur when it is time to perform
#    photometry, i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true,
#    however, this primitive does not make that check.  That is to
#    permit photometry of all the contributing frames of a mosaic.
#    -  An error occurs when the filter is not one of I, Z, Y, J, H,
#    K, L, or M.
#    -  The standard-star catalogue used is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/fs_izyjhklm.dat.
#    However, if this file is unavailable, the script accesses the old
#    $ORAC_DATA_CAL/fs2000.dat, but only for JHK data.  An error
#    results when both catalogues cannot be opened.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive reads the faint-standard catalogue or its
predecessor.  A case- and space-insensitive comparison of the
supplied object name with the entries in the table provides a
catalogue magnitude in I<I>, I<Z>, I<Y>, I<J>, I<H>, I<K>, I<L>,

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item CATMAG = REAL (Returned)

The catalogue magnitude for the object and current frame's filter.

=item NAME = CHARACTER (Given).

The object name.  This can be UKIRT Faint Standard catalogue
number, or the alternative name.

=item NULLMAG = REAL (Given)

A null magnitude when the object has no magnitude for the filter.
[99.999]

=item WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Given)

The name of the waveband.  It may be I, Z, Y J, H, K, L, or M.
It comes from L<_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_|_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_>.
