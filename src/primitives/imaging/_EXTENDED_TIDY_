=head1 NAME

_EXTENDED_TIDY_ -- Removes unwanted intermediate files for the EXTENDEDI<n>xI<m> recipe and its variant.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _ff suffix.
Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided by
the steering header MAKE_GRAND_MOSAIC.  Registration text files with
extensions .find, .off, and .res are also removed.
