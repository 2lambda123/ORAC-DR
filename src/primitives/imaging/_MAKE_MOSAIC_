# Name:
#    _MAKE_MOSAIC_
#
# Purpose:
#    Forms a mosaic.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive makes a mosaic from the object frames in the
#    current cycle of the current $Grp.  There are two main stages:
#    resampling and making the mosaic.
#
#    The primitive either resamples each frame using the non-integer
#    Cartesian offsets, or merely finds the offsets between frames to
#    the nearest pixel and shifts the origin (see argument RESAMPLE).
#    The mosaic can be trimmed to the dimensions of a single
#    contributing frame or can extend to include all pixels in
#    contributing frames (see argument TRIM).

#    The primitive then makes the mosaic using zero-point shifts to give
#    the most self-consistent mosaic based upon the statistics of
#    overlapping pixels.  On the first cycle, the mosaic becomes the
#    group file and its headers read.  On subsequent cycles, the current
#    mosaic is added into the group or `grand' mosaic.
#
#    To prevent the accumulated build up of bad pixels in the grand
#    mosaic, there is an option (argument FILLBAD) to fill in bad pixels
#    by using a smooth function which matches the surrounding data.  The
#    function is an iterative approximation to a solution of Laplace's
#    equation.
#
# Arguments:
#    FILLBAD = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), replace the bad pixels in the current cycle's
#       mosaic with a smooth function derived from its neighbours. 
#       Otherwise, leave the bad pixels unaltered.  [1]
#    INT_METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The interpolation method.  This is either "linint" for bi-linear
#       interpolation, or "nearest" for nearest neighbour.  The latter
#       takes about half the time.  ["linint"]
#    METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The method used to combine frames to form the mosaic.  See
#       parameter METHOD of CCDPACK/MAKEMOS (SUN/139) for the options.
#       The main two in practice will be "Median" or "Mean".  The former
#       excludes outliers but has problems in good seeing where the
#       registration is poor, as it biases against the peak values of
#       the steepening profile near the core, and hence underestimate
#       the flux.  In this circumstance the mean blurs the psf profile,
#       making it more of a plateau than a sharp peak.  However, the
#       mean preserves the flux, at the cost of the odd rogue value
#       affecting the result.  ["Mean"]
#    OPTOV = INTEGER (Given)
#       Optimum number of overlaps to be used when making the mosaic. 
#       See the CCDPACK/MAKEMOS documentation in SUN/139 for more
#       details.  The default is one less than the number of frames in
#       a jitter, given by steering header JITTER_NUMBER; or eight if
#       JITTER_NUMBER is undefined. []
#    RESAMPLE = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), resample the current cycle's frames to the same
#       Cartesian co-ordinate system using the method given by argument
#       INT_METHOD.  If false (0), use integer offsets and changes of
#       origin to register the frames.  The latter is many times
#       faster and is recommended for pipeline operation.  [1]
#    SKYWCS = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), the mosaic file has its world co-ordinate frame
#       set to sky domain, thus appear on supported graphics, provided
#       a sky frame exists.  Otherwise the frame will be unchanged,
#       presumably set to domain PIXEL or CCD_REG. [1]
#    TRIM = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), the resampling limits the frame bounds to their
#       original limits, so the mosaic has the dimensions of a single
#       contributing frame.  If false (0), the resampling or shifting
#       imposes no limit to the frame bounds, so the mosaic can extend
#       to include all pixels in contributing frames.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when the
#    steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is true.
#    -  When RESAMPLE is false, the offset files (.off extension)
#    associated with each frame are interrogated to find one common
#    object.  This is identifier 1 if telescope or central-source 
#    offsets are used, but the script searches upwards from 1 the first
#    nine identifiers, if necessary, until it finds a match.  For each 
#    frame the read x-y co-ordinates rounded to the nearest integer and
#    with opposite sign become the new origin.
#    -  Group internal header ROOT_NAME stores the name of the mosaic
#    excluding any suffix.  It is written for the first cycle,
#    and read back for subsequent cycles of the recipe.
#    -  The start and end airmasses of the grand mosaic are revised to
#    the limiting values for the first and last contributing frames
#    respectively.  Likewise the exposure time is summed.
#    -  The individual mosaic and grand mosaic are displayed.
#    -  The frame titles are propagated.
#    -  The optimum number of overlaps for the mosaic creation is set 
#    to the value of steering header JITTER_NUMBER (defaults to 9)
#    minus one.  The default permits all frames to compare with all
#    the others up to a 9-point jitter.
#    -  Code to concatenate field rotation into the resampling is
#    commented out.  This is because rotation should be handled by the
#    world co-ordinate system, not by resampling and hence degrading the
#    data.
#
# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: MAKEMOS, TRANNDF; KAPPA: ADD, FILLBAD, FITSMOD, NDFCOPY,
#    NDFTRACE, SETORIGIN, WCSFRAME.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  The grand mosaic, which is called is "<groupname>_mos", where
#    <groupname> is the name of the group.  For multiple cycles, single 
#    mosaics are also retained and called <groupname>_mos_<cyclenumber>,
#    where <cyclenumber> is the cycle number derived from steering
#    header CYCLE_NUMBER.
#    -  Resampled frames each inheriting the name of its input frame but
#    with the _trn suffix, when RESAMPLE is true.

=head1 NAME 

_MAKE_MOSAIC_ -- Forms a mosaic.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive makes a mosaic from the object frames in the
current cycle of the current $Grp.  There are two main stages:
resampling and making the mosaic.

The primitive either resamples each frame using the non-integer
Cartesian offsets, or merely finds the offsets between frames to
the nearest pixel and shifts the origin (see argument RESAMPLE).
The mosaic can be trimmed to the dimensions of a single
contributing frame or can extend to include all pixels in
contributing frames (see argument TRIM).

The primitive then makes the mosaic using zero-point shifts to give
the most self-consistent mosaic based upon the statistics of
overlapping pixels.  On the first cycle, the mosaic becomes the
group file and its headers read.  On subsequent cycles, the current
mosaic is added into the group or `grand' mosaic.

To prevent the accumulated build up of bad pixels in the grand
mosaic, there is an option (argument FILLBAD) to fill in bad pixels
by using a smooth function which matches the surrounding data.  The
function is an iterative approximation to a solution of Laplace's
equation.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item FILLBAD = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), replace the bad pixels in the current cycle's
mosaic with a smooth function derived from its neighbours. 
Otherwise, leave the bad pixels unaltered.  [1]

=item INT_METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)

The interpolation method.  This is either "linint" for bi-linear
interpolation, or "nearest" for nearest neighbour.  The latter
takes about half the time.  ["linint"]

=item METHOD = CHARACTER (Given)

The method used to combine frames to form the mosaic.  See
parameter METHOD of CCDPACK/MAKEMOS (SUN/139) for the options.
The main two in practice will be "Median" or "Mean".  The former
excludes outliers but has problems in good seeing where the
registration is poor, as it biases against the peak values of
the steepening profile near the core, and hence underestimate
the flux.  In this circumstance the mean blurs the psf profile,
making it more of a plateau than a sharp peak.  However, the
mean preserves the flux, at the cost of the odd rogue value
affecting the result.  ["Mean"]

=item OPTOV = INTEGER (Given)

Optimum number of overlaps to be used when making the mosaic.  See the
CCDPACK/MAKEMOS documentation in SUN/139 for more details.  The default
is one less than the number of frames in a jitter, given by steering
header JITTER_NUMBER; or eight if JITTER_NUMBER is undefined. []

=item RESAMPLE = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), resample the current cycle's frames to the same
Cartesian co-ordinate system using the method given by argument
INT_METHOD.  If false (0), use integer offsets and changes of
origin to register the frames.  The latter is many times
faster and is recommended for pipeline operation.  [1]

=item SKYWCS = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), the mosaic file has its world co-ordinate frame
set to sky domain, thus appear on supported graphics, provided
a sky frame exists.  Otherwise the frame will be unchanged,
presumably set to domain PIXEL or CCD_REG. [1]

=item TRIM = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), the resampling limits the frame bounds to their
original limits, so the mosaic has the dimensions of a single
contributing frame.  If false (0), the resampling or shifting
imposes no limit to the frame bounds, so the mosaic can extend
to include all pixels in contributing frames.  [0]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when the
steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is true.

=item *

When RESAMPLE is false, the offset files (.off extension)
associated with each frame are interrogated to find one common
object.  This is identifier 1 if telescope or central-source 
offsets are used, but the script searches upwards from 1 the first
nine identifiers, if necessary, until it finds a match.  For each 
frame the read x-y co-ordinates rounded to the nearest integer and
with opposite sign become the new origin.

=item *

Group internal header ROOT_NAME stores the name of the mosaic
excluding any suffix.  It is written for the first cycle,
and read back for subsequent cycles of the recipe.

=item *

The start and end airmasses of the grand mosaic are revised to
the limiting values for the first and last contributing frames
respectively.  Likewise the exposure time is summed.

=item *

The individual mosaic and grand mosaic are displayed.

=item *

The frame titles are propagated.

=item *

The optimum number of overlaps for the mosaic creation is set 
to the value of steering header JITTER_NUMBER (defaults to 9)
minus one.  The default permits all frames to compare with all
the others up to a 9-point jitter.

=item *

Code to concatenate field rotation into the resampling is
commented out.  This is because rotation should be handled by the
world co-ordinate system, not by resampling and hence degrading the
data.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The grand mosaic, which is called is "E<lt>groupnameE<gt>_mos", where
E<lt>groupnameE<gt> is the name of the group.  For multiple cycles,
single mosaics are also retained and called
E<lt>groupnameE<gt>_mos_E<lt>cyclenumberE<gt>, where
E<lt>cyclenumberE<gt> is the cycle number derived from steering header
CYCLE_NUMBER.

=item *

Resampled frames each inheriting the name of its input frame but
with the _trn suffix, when RESAMPLE is true.
