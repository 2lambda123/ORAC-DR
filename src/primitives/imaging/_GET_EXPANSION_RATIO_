=head1 NAME

_GET_EXPANSION_RATIO_ - Return the expansion ratio for interleaving.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive determines the expansion ratio when interleaving frames
together.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item X_EXPANSION = INTEGER (Returned)

The expansion factor along the X-axis.

=item Y_EXPANSION = INTEGER (Returned)

The expansion factor along the Y-axis.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

An expansion factor of 1 means that no expansion is done. An expansion
factor of 2 means that the resolution is increased by a factor of 2,
i.e. from 0.4 arcseconds per pixel to 0.2 arcseconds per pixel.
