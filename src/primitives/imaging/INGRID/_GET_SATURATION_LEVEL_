# Name:
#    _GET_SATURATION_LEVEL_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the INGRID saturation level in ADU the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the INGRID saturation level in ADU for the current
#    frame.
#
#    The saturation level is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    SATURATION = REAL (Returned)
#       The saturation level obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for INGRID.
#    -  It merely uses a constant, depending on the UT date (from user
#    header ORAC_UTDATE):
#       2000 May 1 to 2001 Feb 28: 28000 ADU
#       2001 Mar 1 to 2001 Aug 31: 22000 ADU
