# Name:
#    _GET_PLATE_SCALE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the pixel scales measured in arcseconds per pixel for the
#    current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the pixel increments from the headers of the
#    current frame in arcseconds per pixel units.  The scales are returned
#    in three arguments.
#
# Arguments:
#    DECSCALE = REAL (Returned)
#       The increment along the declination axis of the current
#       frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.  This is positive.
#    PLATESCALE = REAL (Returned)
#       The geometric-mean plate scale, i.e. the average of the absolute
#       values of DECSCALE and RASCALE.
#    RASCALE = REAL (Returned)
#       The increment along the right-ascension axis of the current
#       frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.  This may be negative.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for INGRID.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  The platescale internal headers are ORAC_RA_SCALE and
#    ORAC_DEC_SCALE.  Should a header be undefined first the products of
#    headers INGPSCAL and CCD[XY]PIXE times [-+]1000 are tried instead, and
#    failing that default values of are substituted for right ascension and
#    declination respectively.  The defaults depends on the UT date (from
#    user header ORAC_UTDATE):
#       2000 May 1 to 2001 Feb 28: -0.242,  0.242
#       other dates              : -0.2387, 0.2387

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the pixel increments from the headers of the
current frame in arcseconds per pixel units.  The scales are returned
in three arguments.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item DECSCALE = REAL (Returned)

The increment along the declination axis of the current
frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.  This is positive.

=item PLATESCALE = REAL (Returned)

The geometric-mean plate scale, i.e. the average of the absolute values
of DECSCALE and RASCALE.

=item RASCALE = REAL (Returned)

The increment along the right-ascension axis of the current
frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.  This may be negative.
