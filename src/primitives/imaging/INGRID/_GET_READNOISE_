# Name:
#    _GET_READNOISE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the INGRID readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
#    frame.  It first attempts to find a value for the calibration
#    system.  Where there is no value, it tries a header for the value,
#    and if that's not defined, the primitive assigns a default.
#
#    The readnoise is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    READNOISE = REAL (Returned)
#       The readnoise obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for INGRID.
#    -  The read noise comes from the readnoise calibration, or
#    failing that the header READNOIS.
#    -  The default depends on the UT date (from user header ORAC_UTDATE),
#    and correspond to one multiread, and the upper limits of the
#    documented ranges.  These defaults are:
#       2000 May 1 to 2001 Feb 28: 65 e
#       2001 Mar 1 to 2001 Aug 31: 45 e
#       other dates              : 25 e

_GET_READNOISE_ -- Finds the INGRID readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value for the calibration
system.  Where there is no value, it tries a header for the value,
and if that's not defined, the primitive assigns a default.

The readnoise is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=item READNOISE = REAL (Returned)

The readnoise obtained.

=item *

This primitive is only suitable for INGRID.

=item *

The read noise comes from the readnoise calibration, or failing that
the header READNOIS.

The default depends on the UT date (from user header ORAC_UTDATE),
and correspond to one multiread, and the upper limits of the
documented ranges.  These defaults are:
