# Name:
#    _DIFFERENCE_PRE_POST_
#
# Purpose:
#    Differences pairs of INGRID pre- and post-exposure images.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive subtracts the pre-exposure frame I1 from the
#    post-exposure frame I2 of an INGRID observation.   It reports
#    a successful subtraction and the frames concerned.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for INGRID.
#    -  The differenced image can be displayed.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Differenced frame inheriting the frame's name but with the
#    _dcb suffix.

# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: SUB.

# The data are stored in an HDS container file as a series of NDFs.
# The pre-exposure image is called .I1 and the post-exposure image is
# .I2.  We need to difference to generate a proper raw frame as a
# simple NDF.  While the conversion infrastructure could do this, it
# would prevent calculation of the data errors.  Thus the DR
# $Frm->files method returns a list of the beams in order .I1, .I2.

# Obtain the input filenames.
    my $in1 = $Frm->file( 1 );
    my $in2 = $Frm->file( 2 );

# File the output frame in the Frame object.  Merge the headers.
# This generates a simple NDF instead of a multi-NDF HDS container.
    $Frm->files( $in2 );
#    $Frm->mergehdr;

# Generate the output filename scb = subtracted chop beam
    my ( $in, $out ) = $Frm->inout( "_dcb" );

# Form the difference of the chop beams A minus B.
    $Mon{'kappa_mon'}->obeyw( "sub", "in1=$in2 in2=$in1 out=$out title=!" );

# Report the processing status.
    orac_print "$in2 - $in1 to $out: \n   Differenced pre- and post-exposure frames.\n";

# File the output frame in the Frame object.
    $Frm->file( $out );

# Display the differenced image.
    $Display->display_data( $Frm ) if ( defined $Display );
