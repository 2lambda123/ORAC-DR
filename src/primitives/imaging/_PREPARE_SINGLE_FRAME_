=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive does the preparatory work for recipes used by UFTI,
IRCAM, or Michelle in imaging mode.  It first masks bad pixels.  It
can create a variance array using the readout noise, remove a bias
frame or null bias, add photon noise to the variance, difference
chopped beams, and create a valid WCS.  What is actually performed
depends on steering headers.
