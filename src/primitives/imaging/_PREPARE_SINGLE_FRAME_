# Create a variance array with the readout noise.
    _ADD_READNOISE_VARIANCE_

# This only removes a bias for chopped data.  For normal data, a

# Add photon noise to the earlier variance.

# Difference the two chop beams.
    _DIFFERENCE_CHOP_BEAMS_

# Difference data where there are a pre-exposure and post-exposure
# images to form a simple NDF.
    _DIFFERENCE_PRE_POST_

# Apply non-linearity correction to the differenced pre-exposure and
# post-exposure images.  Applying the correction here does mean a slight

_PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME_ -- Performs preparatory data-reduction tasks for imaging instruments.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive does the preparatory work for recipes used by
infra-red imaging instruments.  It first masks bad pixels.  It
can create a variance array using the readout noise, remove a bias
frame or null bias, add photon noise to the variance, difference
chopped beams or pre-exposure from post exposure frames, apply
a non-linearity correction to differenced post-pre exposures and
create a valid WCS.  What is actually performed depends on steering
headers.
