# Name:
#    _GET_GAIN_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the LCO instrument gain in electrons per ADU for the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the gain in electrons per ADU for the current
#    frame.  It first attempts to find a value from the ORAC_GAIN header.
#    If this is null or less than 3.0, the primitive uses a
#    time-dependent default value, and it reports the use of the default.
#
#    The gain is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    GAIN = REAL (Returned)
#       The gain obtained.

_GET_GAIN_ -- Finds the LCO instrument gain in electrons per ADU for
the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the gain in electrons per ADU for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value from the ORAC_GAIN header.
If this is null or less than 3.0, the primitive uses a
time-dependent default value, and it reports the use of the default.

The gain is returned through an argument.
