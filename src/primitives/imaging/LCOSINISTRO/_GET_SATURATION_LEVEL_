# Name:
#    _GET_SATURATION_LEVEL_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the LCOSINISTRO saturation level in electrons for the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the LCOSINISTRO saturation level in electrons for the current
#    frame. The header is checked to see if a header value is present and it's
#    not 0 or less than 600000; in these cases a default of 100,000 electrons is
#    used.
#
#    The saturation level is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    SATURATION = REAL (Returned)
#       The saturation level obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for LCOSINISTRO.

=head1 NAME

_GET_SATURATION_LEVEL_ -- Finds the LCOSINISTRO saturation level in electrons
for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the LCOSINISTRO saturation level in electrons for the
current frame. The header is checked to see if a header value is present and it's
not 0 or less than 600000; in these cases a default of 100,000 electrons is
used.

The saturation level is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=item SATURATION = REAL (Returned)

The saturation level obtained.
