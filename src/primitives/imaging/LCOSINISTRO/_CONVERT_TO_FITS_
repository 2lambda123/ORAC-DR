CONVERT_TO_FITS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Converts current observation to FITS. This differs from the regular LCOSBIG
primitive in that we obtain the saturation level and set to that. This is
because SINISTRO is pre-converted to electrons and so we can get values greater
than 65535.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item FILENAME = CHARACTER (Returned)

The name of the converted FITS file.
