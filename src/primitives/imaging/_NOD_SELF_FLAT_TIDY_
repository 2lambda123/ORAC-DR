# Name:
#    _NOD_SELF_FLAT_TIDY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Removes unwanted intermediate files for the NOD_SELF_FLAT recipe
#    variants.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _ff suffix.
#    Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided
#    by the steering headers FLAT_DIVIDE, MAKE_MOSAIC and CYCLE_NUMBER,
#    and group internal header DIFFERENCE_GROUP.  Registration text files
#    with extension .off are also removed.

_NOD_SELF_FLAT_TIDY_ -- Removes unwanted intermediate files for the NOD_SELF_FLAT recipe and its variant.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Removes intermediate frames, but retaining those with the _ff suffix.
Files are only removed when they are no longer needed, as guided by
the steering headers FLAT_DIVIDE, MAKE_MOSAIC and CYCLE_NUMBER, and
group internal header DIFFERENCE_GROUP.  Registration text files with
extension .off are also removed.
