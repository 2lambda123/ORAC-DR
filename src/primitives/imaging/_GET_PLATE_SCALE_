# Name:
#    _GET_PLATE_SCALE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the pixel scale measured in arcseconds per pixel for the
#    current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the pixel increment(s) from the headers of the
#    current frame, and if necessary, converts them to arcseconds per
#    pixel.  This allows CDELTn to be used either in a World Co-ordinate
#    System or as the pixel scale directly.  The scales are returned
#    in two arguments.
#
# Arguments:
#    DECSCALE = REAL (Returned)
#       The telescope offset along the Declination axis of the current 
#       frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.
#    RASCALE = REAL (Returned)
#       The telescope offset along the Right Ascension axis of the current 
#       frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  The platescale internal headers are ORAC_RASCALE and ORAC_DECSCALE.
#    Header CTYPE1 set to 'RA---TAN' indicates the presence of the
#    AIPS-convention WCS.

_GET_PLATE_SCALE_ -- Finds the pixel scale measured in arcseconds per pixel for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the pixel increment(s) from the headers of the
current frame, and if necessary, converts them to arcseconds per
pixel.  This allows CDELTn to be used either in a World Co-ordinate
System or as the pixel scale directly.  The scales are returned
in two arguments.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item DECSCALE = REAL (Returned)

The telescope offset along the Declination axis of the current 
frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.

=item RASCALE = REAL (Returned)

The telescope offset along the Right Ascension axis of the current 
frame measured in arcseconds per pixel.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item 4

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.

=item *

The platescale internal headers are ORAC_RASCALE and ORAC_DECSCALE.
Header CTYPE1 set to 'RA---TAN' indicates the presence of the
AIPS-convention WCS.
