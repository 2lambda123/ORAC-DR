# Name:
#    _ARRAY_TEST_STATISTICS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Determines the state of the imaging detectors for the ARRAY_TESTS
#    recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive calls the various instrument-specific primitives
#    which evaluate the readout noise and the dark current for UFTI
#    and IRCAM.  See _UFTI_ARRAY_TEST_STATISTICS_ and
#    _IRCAM_ARRAY_TEST_STATISTICS_ for details.
#
# Notes:
#    -  The current frame's header INSTRUME is used to decide which 
#    instrument-specific primitive to use.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive calls the various instrument-specific primitives which
evaluate the readout noise and the dark current for UFTI and IRCAM.
See L<_UFTI_ARRAY_TEST_STATISTICS_|_UFTI_ARRAY_TEST_STATISTICS_> and
L<_IRCAM_ARRAY_TEST_STATISTICS_|_IRCAM_ARRAY_TEST_STATISTICS_> for
details.

=item *

The current frame's header INSTRUME is used to decide which 
instrument-specific primitive to use.
