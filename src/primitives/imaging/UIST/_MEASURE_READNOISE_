=head1 NAME

_MEASURE_READNOISE_ - measures readnoise for an array tests sequence
for UIST.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive measures the readnoise for a group of UIST dark frames,
reports it to the user, and files this readnoise in a log file named
uist_array_tests.log in the $ORAC_DATA_OUT directory.

This primitive assumes the following order for an array tests sequence:

=over 4

=item One throwaway frame used to "clean up" the array before statistics
are done on the remaining frames.

=item A group of frames that will be used to determine the readnoise.
These frames should be short-exposure DARKs.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The readnoise is calculated as follows:

=over 4

=item * The population variance estimate (PVE) of five dark frames
is calculated on a per-pixel basis.

=item * The square root of the mean of this PVE image is calculated.

=item * If the images were taken before UT 2002-12-02, the readnoise
is calculated as the square root of the mean
of the PVE multiplied by (number of reads - 1) multiplied by the
read interval multiplied by the gain and divided by the number of
multiple reads. Otherwise, the readnoise is calculated as the
square root of the mean multiplied by the gain.

=back

=item *

The readnoise is nominal if it falls between 38 and 45 e-/seconds.
