# Name:
#    _VALIDATE_RAW_DATA_
#
# Purpose:
#    Tests the validity of the raw data, such as count rates.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This recipe checks the value of the ARRAY_EN header. If it
#    is defined and is set to 'OFF', then the pipeline will throw
#    an error.
#
#    Polarimetry status is also checked. If the POLARISE header
#    indicates polarimetry is being performed, yet the IRPOLARM header
#    is 'Retracted', then the pipeline will throw an error.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UIST in imaging mode.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive checks the value of the ARRAY_EN header. If it is
defined and is set to 'OFF', then the pipeline will throw an error.

Polarimetry mode is also checked. If the POLARISE header indicates
polarimetry is being performed, yet the IRPOLARM header is
'Retracted', then the pipeline will throw an error.

=head1 NOTES

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UIST in imaging mode.
