# Name:
#    _INSTRUMENT_HELLO_
#
# Purpose:
#    Performs the instrument-specific imaging setup.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive is performs the instrument specific setup for
#    imaging.  It's needed for the generic _IMAGING_HELLO_.  In this
#    case it brings the data values in each integration for ND modes
#    into line with other instruments, and are total ADU, not ADU/s.
#    The primitive reports the creation of each corrected integration.
#    It also reports that the set-up operations are complete.
#
#  Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UIST in imaging mode.
#    -  It accesses the user header ORAC_DETECTOR_READ_TYPE to determine
#    whether or it is an "ND..." read type.
#    -  The exposure time comes from user header ORAC_EXPOSURE_TIME.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  For NDSTARE and NDCHOP data, the data are scaled to ADU
#    in a frame inheriting the current frame's name but with the _adu
#    suffix.

_INSTRUMENT_HELLO_ -- Performs the instrument-specific imaging setup.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive is performs the instrument specific setup for
imaging.  It's needed for the generic L<_IMAGING_HELLO_|_IMAGING_HELLO_>.
In this case it brings the data values in each integration for ND modes
into line with other instruments, and are total ADU, not ADU/s.
The primitive reports the creation of each corrected integration.
It also reports that the set-up operations are complete.
