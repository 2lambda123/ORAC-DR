# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the bias in volts for the current frame.

_GET_BIAS_VOLTAGE_ -- Finds the UIST bias in volts for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the bias in volts for the current frame. It
does this by taking the difference of the VDETCOM and VDDUC file
headers.

The bias is returned through an argument.
