=head1 NAME

_MEASURE_DARK_CURRENT_ - measure the dark current for a given frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Measures the dark current for a given frame. The dark current is 
calculated as the unclipped mean of the current frame, and is reported
in ADU.

If this primitive is run at UKIRT, the dark current will be stored
in a logfile at /ukirt_sw/logs/uist_array_tests.log
