# Name:
#    _GET_FRAME_CENTRE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the pixel co-ordinates of the centre of the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the pixel co-ordinates of the frame centre
#    from the bounds of the current frame.   The co-ordinates are returned
#    in two arguments.
#
# Arguments:
#    XCENTRE = REAL (Returned)
#       The x co-ordinate of the frame centre.
#    YCENTRE = REAL (Returned)
#       The y co-ordinate of the frame centre.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for IRCAM, UFTI, and Michelle in
#    imaging mode.
