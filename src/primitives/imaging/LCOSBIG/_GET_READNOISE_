# Name:
#    _GET_READNOISE_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the LCOSPECTRAL readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
#    frame.  It first attempts to find a value for the calibration
#    system.  Where there is no value, it tries a header for the value,
#    and if that's not defined, the primitive assigns a default.
#
#    The readnoise is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    READNOISE = REAL (Returned)
#       The readnoise obtained.

_GET_READNOISE_ -- Finds the LCOSPECTRAL readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value for the calibration
system.  Where there is no value, it tries a header for the value,
and if that's not defined, the primitive assigns a default.

The readnoise is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item READNOISE = REAL (Returned)

The readnoise obtained.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is only suitable for LCOSPECTRAL.

=item *

The read noise comes from the readnoise calibration, or failing that
the header READNOIS.
