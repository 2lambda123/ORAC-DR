# Name:
#    _DERIVED_PRODUCTS_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for DERIVED_PRODUCTS recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive control processing for DERIVED_PRODUCTS recipe through
#    steering headers listed below.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    ADD_ASTROMETRY = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not automated astrometry is to occur.  This equates to
#       argument DOASTROM.
#
#    CREATE_CATALOGUE = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not catalogue creation is to occur.  This equates to
#       argument DOIMGCAT.
#
#    CALCULATE_SEEING_STATS = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not seeing statistics should be calculated.  This equates to
#       argument DOSEEING.
#
#    QUICK_LOOK = LOGICAL
#       Whether we are running in "quicklook" mode.  This equates to
#       argument DOQUICKLOOK.
#
# Arguments:
#    DOASTROM = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to perform astrometry.  [1]
#
#    DOIMGCAT = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to perform catalogue creation.  [1]
#
#    DOSEEING = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to calculate seeing statistics.  [1]
#
#    DOQUICKLOOK = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not we should do quicklook processing.  [1]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for LCOGT imaging CCD cameras.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object frames.
