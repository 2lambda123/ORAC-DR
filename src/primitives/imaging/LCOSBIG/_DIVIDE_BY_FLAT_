# Name:
#    _DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_
#
# Purpose:
#    Flat-fields a frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive divides the current frame by the most-recent and
#    matching flat-field frame from $Cal->flat method.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  The flat-fielded image can be displayed.
#    -  The frame title is propagated.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Flat-fielded frame inheriting the frame's name but with the
#    _ff suffix.
#
# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: FLATCOR.
