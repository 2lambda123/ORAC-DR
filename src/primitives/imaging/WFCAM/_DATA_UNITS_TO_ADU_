=head1 NAME

_DATA_UNITS_TO_ADU_ -- Converts data units to ADU.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EDICTs data frames taken before UT 2002-12-02 have units of ADU per second
when in any ND mode (ie NDSTARE or NDCHOP).

This primitive multiplies such frames by their exposure times to get them
into total ADU which is what the rest of the downstream pipeline expects.
It then divides by the number of reads to get the total ADU per exposure.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

For frames taken after UT 20061023, this primitive multiplies data
frames by their exposure time, then divides by the number of reads to
get the total ADU per exposure.
