=head1 NAME

_VERIFY_DARK_ -- Verify the suitability of a WFCAM dark by performing
various statistical analyses on it.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive checks a given dark frame for suitability. Currently it
checks for the edge enhancement problem and the light leak problem.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item EDGE_ENHANCEMENT = BOOLEAN (Returned)

Whether or not channel edges are enhanced.

=item LIGHT_LEAK = BOOLEAN (Returned)

Whether or not a light leak is detected.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for WFCAM.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

None.

=back

=head1 TASKS

None. All checks are done by separate primitives.

=head1 REQUIRED PERL MODULES

None.
