=head1 NAME

_DETECT_CHANNEL_EDGES_ - Detect when WFCAM's channel edges have been
'enhanced' by an electronics bug.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Occasionally the channel edges on WFCAM's chips go wonky, such that a
bright channel appears. This primitive looks at pixels
(1025,1025:2048) (which is on a channel edge) and compares its value
with that at pixels (1030,1025:2048) (which is not on a channel
edge). If the ratio of the two is greater than a given threshold, then
the channel edges are considered to be 'enhanced'.

A clipped mean is performed to determine the values, which should
eliminate false-positives caused by stars, single hot pixels, etc.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item ENHANCED = BOOLEAN (Returned)

If the channel edges are 'enhanced', then this value will be set to
true (1). Otherwise, this value will be set to false (0).

=item THRESHOLD = REAL (Given)

If the absolute value of the ratio of the values is greater than this
threshold, then the channel edges are considered to be
'enhanced'. [100.0]
