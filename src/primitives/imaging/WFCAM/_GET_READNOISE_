=head1 NAME

_GET_READNOISE_ -- Finds the WFCAM readnoise in electrons for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the readnoise in electrons for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value for the calibration system.
Where there is no value or suitable value with matching attributes
such as read type, speed and gain, the primitive assigns default
values using those attributes.

The readnoise is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS
