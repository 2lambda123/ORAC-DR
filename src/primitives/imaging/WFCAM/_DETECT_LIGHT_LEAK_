=head1 NAME

_DETECT_LIGHT_LEAK_ - Detect a light leak for long darks.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For part of its operation, WFCAM suffered from a light leak problem
which shows up on long-exposure dark frames taken at the beginning of
the night when the dome is still light. This primitive looks at the
central 10% of the array, and if the mean value is larger than 20 (for
cameras 1, 2, and 3) or 30 (for camera 4), then a light leak is
present.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item LEAK = BOOLEAN (Returned)

Whether or not a light leak is detected.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for WFCAM.
