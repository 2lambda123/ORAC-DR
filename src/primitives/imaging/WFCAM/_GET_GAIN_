=head1 NAME

_GET_GAIN_ -- Finds the WFCAM gain in electrons per ADU for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the gain in electrons per ADU for the current
frame. It first attempts to find a value from the header. If this
is null, the primitive uses a default value and reports the use of
the default.

The gain is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS
