# Name:
#    _GET_PIXEL_OFFSETS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the offsets of the reference pixel relative to the frame centre.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive derives the pixel offsets of the reference pixel
#    with respect to of the frame centre.  It merely differences the
#    values returned by _GET_FRAME_CENTRE_ from the values of user headers
#    ORAC_X_REFERENCE_PIXEL and ORAC_Y_REFERENCE_PIXEL.
#
#    The offsets are returned in two arguments.
#
# Arguments:
#    XOFFSET = REAL (Returned)
#       The x offset in pixels of the reference pixel with respect to
#       the x frame centre.
#    YOFFSET = REAL (Returned)
#       The y offset in pixels of the reference pixel with respect to
#       the y frame centre.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for IRCAM, UFTI, and UIST and Michelle
#    in imaging mode.

=head1 NAME

_GET_PIXEL_OFFSETS_ -- Finds the offsets of the reference pixel relative to the frame centre.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive derives the pixel offsets of the reference pixel with
respect to of the frame centre.  It merely differences the values
returned by L<_GET_FRAME_CENTRE_|_GET_FRAME_CENTRE_> from the values of
user headers ORAC_X_REFERENCE_PIXEL and ORAC_Y_REFERENCE_PIXEL.

The offsets are returned in two arguments.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item XOFFSET = REAL (Returned)

The I<x> offset in pixels of the reference pixel with respect to
the I<x> frame centre.

=item YOFFSET = REAL (Returned)

The I<y> offset in pixels of the reference pixel with respect to
the I<y> frame centre.

imaging mode.
