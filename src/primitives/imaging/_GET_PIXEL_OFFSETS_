_GET_PIXEL_OFFSETS_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive returns the offset of a target from the centre of the array.
This offset is returned in two arguments.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item XOFFSET = REAL (Returned)

The I<x> offset, measured in pixels. A negative value means the target
is located to the left of the centre of the array.

=item YOFFSET = REAL (Returned)

The I<y> offset, measured in pixels. A negative value means the target
is located below the centre of the array.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The offsets returned for all arrays are (0, 0).

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI and Michelle in imaging mode.
