=head1 NAME

_CALCULATE_NREADS_NOISE_FACTOR_ - Calculates the noise reduction for N ND reads.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the factor by which the array readnoise is reduced by virtue of
doing several ND reads throughout the exposure.

The Number of reads comes from the NREADS uhdr.

The result is placed in the NREADS_FACTOR uhdr
