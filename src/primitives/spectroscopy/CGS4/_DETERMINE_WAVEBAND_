=head1 NAME

_DETERMINE_WAVEBAND_ -- Determine the waveband for flux calibration and
blackbody calculations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive uses information stored in the headers, primarily the
central wavelength, to determine the waveband for the current spectrum.
It writes the waveband and waveband central wavelength into the
WAVEBAND and WAVEBAND_CENTRE internal headers.
