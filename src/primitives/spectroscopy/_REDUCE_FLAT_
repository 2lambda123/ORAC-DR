=head1 NAME

_REDUCE_FLAT_ - Reduces a flat field frame

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reduces a flat field frame in the normal manner, including division by
a black body model of the black body source, and normalisation.

=head1 NOTES

Normalising by a black body probably isn't optimal for sky-flats,
especially if they contain strong lines.
This primitive will need updating if Michelle is to use sky flats.
