=head1 NAME

_ADD_READNOSE_VARIANCE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Adds an initial variance component, which is simply flat and equal to
the readnoise of the detector, taking the GAIN and number of exposures
into account.

This should be done properly with the Cal system to pull the value
from the previous array_tests. For now, it's hard-coded to 40
electrons.
