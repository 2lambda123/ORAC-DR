_SBPOL_PAIR_SUBTRACT_ - Do pair subtraction for single-beam polarimetry.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subtracts the sky / offset beam frame from the object / main beam frame
when taking pair-wise data. This primitive relies on a steering primitive
to set the ON_SOURCE user header to determine which frame is on-source. If
this user header is not set, the primitive will subtract two frames
regardless, warn the user, and continue on.

This primitive is meant for single-beam polarimetry data that is taken
in an angle-first sequence: step through four angles on the object, nod
to sky, then step through the four angles again on the sky.
