=head1 NAME

_MASK_DEVIANT_PIXELS_ - Applies a bad-pixel mask.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive is to flag extreme pixel values as bad.

This version in generic spectroscopy doesn't actually do anything.
Instruments that want to use this should have their own versions of
this in their instrument specific directory.
