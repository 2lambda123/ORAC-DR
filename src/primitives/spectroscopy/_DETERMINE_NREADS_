=head1 NAME

_DETERMINE_NREADS_ - Determine the number of array reads / exposure

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Adds a Frame user header (NREADS) that contains the number of
array reads per exposure.

In this (generic spectroscopy) version, this is simply copied
from the fits header NREADS.

This fits header exists for MICHELLE data, and presumably will for
UIST data too. It does not for CGS4 - an instrument specific
primitive is provided for instruments that do not contain this fits 
header, which determines the number of reads from the exposure time,
with programmed knowledge of the array controller software.
