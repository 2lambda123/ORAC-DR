=head1 NAME

_INSTRUMENT_HELLO_ - Instrument specific initialisation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Any instrument specific initialisation for the spectroscopy pipeline
is done in the instrument specific _INSTRUMENT_HELLO_ primitive. This
is called close to the start of _SPECTROSCOPY_HELLO_ near the start of
processing for each frame. If a given instrument does not require any
specific initialisation, it should not have an _INSTRUMENT_HELLO_
primitive, and this generic, null, one will be called instead.
