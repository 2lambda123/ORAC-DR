=head1 NAME

_MASK_FLAT_BAD_PIXELS_ - Flags as bad pixels in the flat that are
deviant compared to to nearby pixels.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive marks as bad those pixels in the flat that are
significantly different from the pixels nearby. It does this by using
a box five pixels wide to smooth any pixels that are 20-sigma away
from its neighbours.

The result is stored in a file with a _mnf suffix.

This primitive doesn't touch Echelle data - the CGS4 echelle (at
least) has real structure in the flats that confuses this
algorithm. If this is found to be CGS4 specific, the check can be
removed from this generic version into a CGS4 specific one, but for
now I'm assuming this is likely true of all echelle systems.
