=head1 NAME

_FILE_BIAS_ -- Files a frame as the current bias.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This generic primitive files the current frame as the current bias.
It also adds the bias to the index of bias frames.  Both steps are
reported.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item

The current frame must be a bias, otherwise a warning message appears.

=item

The number of files in the current frame must be one.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

Frame bias_I<n>, where I<n> is the original frame number, is a copy of
of the supplied frame.
