=head1 NAME

_ORIENT_IMAGE_NORMALLY_ - Transform the image to the normal orientation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some instruments produce an image in an unusual orientation
- eg the wavelength might increase from right to left rather
than left to right. We use this primitive to re-orientate the
image to a more conventional orientation - ie slit runs up/down,
short wavelength is to the left, long wavelength to the right.

This generic version of thie primitive is null. Instruments that
require a non-null version of this primitive should provide one
in their instrument specific sub directory.
