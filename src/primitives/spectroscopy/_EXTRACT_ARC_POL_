=head1 NAME

_EXTRACT_ARC_POL_ - Extract an arc spectrum for polarimetry data.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Extracts an arc spectrum from the arc image at the position of the
first beam detected by _EXTRACT_FIND_ROWS_POL_. This primitive uses
the user header BEAMS to determine the position of this beam, and
extracts ten rows centered on this position to form the arc spectrum.
