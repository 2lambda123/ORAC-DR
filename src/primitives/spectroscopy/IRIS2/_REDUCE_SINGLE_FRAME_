=head1 NAME

_REDUCE_SINGLE_FRAME_ - Reduces a spectroscopy frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Intended to be run on all OBJECT and SKY science data, and also things
like ARC frames as well.

Contains all the steps necessary to get from raw data to a _wce file.
Variance should be propogated throughout.

This should be the first major primitive in any recipe handling on-sky
data.

=head1 PARAMETERS

An optional NOFLAT parameter, that disables flat fielding.
This is used by the _NOFLAT recipe variants and also when
reducing a flat field frame
