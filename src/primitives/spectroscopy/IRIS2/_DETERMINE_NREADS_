=head1 NAME

_DETERMINE_NREADS_ - Determine the number of array reads / exposure.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Adds a Frame user header (NREADS) that contains the number of
array reads per exposure.

In this IRIS2 version, this is simply copied from the fits header
keyword named READS.

# which uses:   $nreads = $Frm->hdr("ORAC_NUMBER_OF_READS");
# where:        NUMBER_OF_READS        => "READS"
# in lib/perl5/ORAC/Frame/IRIS2.pm
# which doesn't work, as it should say "uhdr" and not "hdr"
# Brad fixed this and placed it in CVS, 8 Jan 2004.
# Reference the keyword directly for now.
