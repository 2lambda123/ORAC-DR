=head1 NAME

_REDUCE_FLAT_CONFIG_ - Sets up config parameters for the flat reduction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets up parameters in the uhdr that are read by the flat reduction
primitives.

At the moment, this is simply the threshold that we use for masking off
under-illuminated areas of the normalised flat - e.g. the ends of the slit.

In this generic version, we use 0.95 which works for CGS4, and hopefully
IRIS2.
