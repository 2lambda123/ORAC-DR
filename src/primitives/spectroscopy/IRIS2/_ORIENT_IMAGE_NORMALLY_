=head1 NAME

_ORIENT_IMAGE_NORMALLY_ - Transform the image to the normal orientation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some instruments produce an image in an unusual orientation
- eg the wavelength might increase from right to left rather
than left to right. We use this primitive to re-orientate the
image to a more conventional orientation - ie slit runs up/down,
short wavelength is to the left, long wavelength to the right.

This version of the primitive is intended for IRIS2 spectroscopic data
taken with the SAPPHIRE_240 grism (i.e. J- and K-band spectra).  Due
to the need to rotate the grism 180 degrees in its cell relative to
the SAPPHIRE_316 grism, so as to get the optimum spectral coverage on
the detector, images taken with this grism have wavelength decreasing
with pixel number. For consistency with the H-band spectra, and to
have wavelength increasing with pixel number, we flip all such data
about the y-axis.
