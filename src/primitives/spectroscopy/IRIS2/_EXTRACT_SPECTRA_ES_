=head1 NAME

_EXTRACT_SPECTRA_ES_ - Extracts spectra from an image.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Extracts spectra from an image. This primitive only runs if a pair
has been completed. This promitive is intended for extended sources
with IRIS2 (or standard stars for extended sources) where the beams
are to be extracted around rows 185 and 670, rather than the usual
580/640.


=head1 PARAMETERS

This primitive simply passes on parameters to the lower level
primitives it calls.

Availiable parameters are:

ROWSCAL: [LOAD|SAVE] - instructs the _EXTRACT_FIND_ROWS_ primitive
whether to load details from the calibration system, save details to
the calibration system, or neither.

PROFILECAL : [LOAD|SAVE] - instructs the _EXTRACT_ALL_BEAMS_ primitive
whether to load details from the calibration system, save details to
the calibration system, or neither.
