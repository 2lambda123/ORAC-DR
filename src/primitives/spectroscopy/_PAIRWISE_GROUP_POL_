=head1 NAME

_PAIRWISE_GROUP_POL_ - Create a group file from reduced single frames taken
in a pairwise sequence for polarimetry data.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes reduced single frames taken in a pairwise sequence,
does pair subtraction, coadds the subtracted pair to the appropriate group,
then extracts the spectra.

Processing only happens when the PAIR_COMPLETE header for the current Frame
is true.
