# Name:
#   _LAMP_FLAT_FLAT_HELLO_
#
# Purpose:
#    Sets up data-reduction tasks and data for LAMP_FLAT recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Sets up CCDPACK-related global parameters for LAMP_FLAT recipes. 
#    The settings are as follows.
# 
#    -  The readout bounds in the internal headers ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND,
#    ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND, ORAC_X_UPPER_BOUND, ORAC_Y_UPPER_BOUND define 
#    the pixel limits for processing, i.e. there are no bias strips and 
#    interpolation direction.  
#    -  Error processing is disabled so the readout noise and
#    analogue-to-digital conversions are not specified.
#    -  There is no deferred charge.
#    -  Position list processing tasks expect to find the names of lists
#    stored within NDFs. 
#    -  Logging is to the terminal.
#    -  The data type of NDF arrays is preserved.
#    -  Does not detect saturated pixels.
#    -  Parameters are neither saved from or to a `restoration' file.
#
#    The script also performs the following tasks.
#    -  Calls the steering primitive to set steering headers.
#    -  Calls the imaging _PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME_ primitive to create
#    data errors, subtract integrations for chopped data, remove the bias,
#    and create a valid world co-ordinate system.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of frames in the group.  If absent, the number of
#       offsets, as given by internal header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS, minus
#       one is used.  If neither is available, 2 is used.  An error state 
#       arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer than 2 or is
#       odd numbered.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [1]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for ISAAC in spectroscopy mode.

# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: CCDSETUP.

_LAMP_FLAT_HELLO_ -- Sets up data-reduction tasks and data for LAMP_FLAT recipes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets up CCDPACK-related global parameters for LAMP_FLAT
recipes.  The settings are as follows.

=over 4

=item *

The readout bounds in the internal headers ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND,
ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND, ORAC_X_UPPER_BOUND, ORAC_Y_UPPER_BOUND define the
pixel limits for processing, i.e. there are no bias strips and
interpolation direction.

=item *

Error processing is disabled so the readout noise and
analogue-to-digital conversions are not specified.

=item *

There is no deferred charge.

=item *

Position list processing tasks expect to find the names of lists
stored within NDFs. 

=item *

Logging is to the terminal.

=item *

The data type of NDF arrays is preserved.

=item *

Does not detect saturated pixels.

=item *

Parameters are neither saved from or to a `restoration' file.

The script also performs the following tasks.

=over 4

=item *

Calls the steering primitive to set steering headers.

=item *

Calls the imaging L<_PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME|_PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME_> primitive to
create data errors, subtract integrations for chopped data, remove the bias,
and create a valid world co-ordinate system.
