# Name:
#    _MASK_ENDS_OF_SLIT_ 
#
# Purpose:
#    Flags areas of the frame off the end of the slit as bad.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive marks as bad pixels those areas of the frame off
#    the end of the slit.  It collapses the frame along the axis parallel
#    to the slit, marks as bad rows which are illuminated less than a limit
#    defined in user header FLAT_MASK_THRESHOLD (normally 95%) or more
#    than 2.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for ISAAC in spectroscopy mode.
#    -  Processes all sub-files.
#    -  Each flagged image flat is displayed.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: COMPAVE, MULT, NDFTRACE, PIXDUPE, STATS, THRESH.
#
# Output Data:
#    The flagged images, inheriting the current frame's name
#    but with the _mnsf suffix.
