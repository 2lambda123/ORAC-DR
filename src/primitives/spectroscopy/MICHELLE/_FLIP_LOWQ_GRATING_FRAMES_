# _FLIP_LOWQ_GRATING_FRAMES_

=head1 NAME 

_FLIP_LOWQ_GRATING_FRAMES_  - Flips frames taken with the low-Q grating

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The low-Q grating is installed the wrong way round in the cryostat. We
work around this by simply driving the grating angle to what would
have been negative orders. A side effect of this is that the images
are flipped along their dispersion axis. This grating flips them back.
