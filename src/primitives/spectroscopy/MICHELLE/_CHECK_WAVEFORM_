# Name:
#    _CHECK_WAVEFORM_
#
# Purpose:
#    Provide a sanity check by comparing the waveform name given
#    in the header with other information in the header, then
#    report if there is an inconsistency.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This recipe compares the waveform name in the header with
#    filter names and observation modes to ensure the correct
#    waveform is being used for the given observation. If an
#    incorrect waveform is used, a warning will be issued.
#
# Notes:
#    - The waveform must be "ndrv11small", unless polarimetry
#    is done, in which case no check is performed.

This recipe compares the waveform name in the header with filter
names and observation modes to ensure the correct waveform is being
used for the given observation. If an incorrect waveform is used,
a warning will be issued.
