# Name:
#    _CHECK_WAVEFORM_
#
# Purpose:
#    Provide a sanity check by comparing the waveform name given
#    in the header with other information in the header, then
#    report if there is an inconsistency.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This recipe compares the waveform name in the header with
#    filter names and observation modes to ensure the correct
#    waveform is being used for the given observation. If an
#    incorrect waveform is used, a warning will be issued.
#
# Notes:
#    - If polarimetry is performed, no check is performed.
#
#    - If the data were taken before 20040101, the waveform must
#      be "ndrv11small". Otherwise, the waveform must be "mch_ndr_sw".

_CHECK_WAVEFORM_ - Provide a sanity check by comparing the waveform
name in the header with other information in the header, then report
if there is an inconsistency.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe compares the waveform name in the header with filter
names and observation modes to ensure the correct waveform is being
used for the given observation. If an incorrect waveform is used,
a warning will be issued.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

If polarimetry is performed, no check is performed.

=item *

If the data were taken before 20040101, the waveform must be "ndrv11small".
Otherwise, the waveform must be "mch_ndr_sw".
