=head1 NAME

_MAKE_SKY_ARC_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Uses and object frame to make a sky-arc - ie an arc-like spectrum
consisting of sky lines.

This is intended for Michelle, but may have uses in the thermal
near-IR.  For now, this MICHELLE specific version is the only one that
actually does its stuff.
