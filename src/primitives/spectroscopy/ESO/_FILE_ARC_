_FILE_ARC_ -- Files a frame as the current arc for spectroscopy data.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive files the current frame as the current arc.
It also adds the arc to the index of arc frames.  Both steps are
reported.

=item GROUP = LOGICAL (Given)

If defined, form a group arc.  If undefined a normal
arc is filed.
