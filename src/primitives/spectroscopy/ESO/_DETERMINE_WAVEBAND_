# Name:
#    _DETERMINE_WAVEBAND_
#
# Purpose:
#    Determine the waveband for flux calibration and blackbody calculations.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive uses information stored in the headers, primarily the
#    central wavelength, to determine the waveband for the current spectrum.
#    It writes the waveband and waveband central wavelength into the
#    WAVEBAND and WAVEBAND_CENTRE internal headers.

# Notes:
#    -  The waveband centre is from intenal header ORAC_GRATING_WAVELENGTH,
#    unless this is undefined, where a lookup table for the waveband
#    is used.
