# Name:
#    _CROSS_CORRELATE_ARC_SPECTRUM_ 
#
# Purpose:
#    Performs cross-correlation between a reference arc spectrum and the
#    current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive performs cross-correlation to determine a shift
#    between a reference arc spectrum and the central row of the current
#    Frame, which should probably be an arc spectrum.
#
#    The reference arc spectrum is determined using the calibration system
#    and copied into the ORAC_DATA_OUT directory.  The central row of the
#    current frame is extracted to a file with a _crow suffix, and the two
#    are cross-correlated.  The cross-correlation function is retained.
#    The resulting shift in pixels is returned via the SHIFT argument.
#
#    The primitive reports the name of the reference arc, the creation of the
#    central row and cross-correlation function files, and the pixel shift.
#
# Arguments:
#    SHIFT = REAL (Returned)
#       The shift in pixels between the reference arc and the current Frame.
#
# Notes:
#    -  As this primitive copies the reference arc from the ORAC_DATA_CAL
#    directory, it will not use a reference arc supplied on the command line.
#    -  The associated axis information is removed before cross-correlation
#    as FIGARO:SCROSS can't cope with it being present.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Central row of the current frame inheriting the frame's name but with 
#    the _crow suffix.
#    -  The cross-correlation function inheriting the frame's name but with
#    the _ccf suffix.

=head1 NAME

_CROSS_CORRELATE_ARC_SPECTRUM_ -- Performs cross-correlation between a reference arc
spectrum and the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive performs cross-correlation to determine a shift
between a reference arc spectrum and the central row of the current
Frame, which should probably be an arc spectrum.

The reference arc spectrum is determined using the calibration system
and copied into the C<ORAC_DATA_OUT> directory.  The central row of the
current frame is extracted to a file with a _crow suffix, and the two
are cross-correlated.  The cross-correlation function is retained.
The resulting shift in pixels is returned via the SHIFT argument.

The primitive reports the name of the reference arc, the creation of the
central row and cross-correlation function files, and the pixel shift.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item SHIFT = REAL (Returned)

The shift in pixels between the reference arc and the current Frame.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

As this primitive copies the reference arc from the C<ORAC_DATA_CAL>
directory, it will not use a reference arc supplied on the command line.

=item *

The associated axis information is removed before cross-correlation
as FIGARO:SCROSS can't cope with it being present.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

Central row of the current frame inheriting the frame's name but with 
the _crow suffix.

=item *

The cross-correlation function inheriting the frame's name but with
the _ccf suffix.
