#
# Purpose:
#    Creates the name of the current arc.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive forms the name of the current arc.  The name of

#    Any decimal is replaced by "p" and any []() characters in the

#       The name of the arc frame for the current frame and group.
#
# Notes:
#    -  The attributes used in the name come from the frame user headers
#    ORAC_GRATING_NAME, ORAC_FILTER, and ORAC_SLIT_NAME.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive forms the name of the current arc.  The name of
arc is
arc_E<lt>group_numberE<gt>_E<lt>grating_nameE<gt>_E<lt>filterE<gt>_E<lt>slit_nameE<gt>.
Any decimal is replaced by "p" and any []() characters in the
name removed to avoid confusing HDS.
