# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for REDUCE_ARC recipe.

# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for REDUCE_ARC recipe through

# Steering Headers:

#       The name of the arc for a given filter, slit and grating name, 
#       and the corresponding number of frames used to create it.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for ESO infra-red spectrometers.
#    -  Processing only occurs for arc frames.
