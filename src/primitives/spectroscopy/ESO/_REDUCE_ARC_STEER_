# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for REDUCE_ARC recipe.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This primitive control processing for REDUCE_ARC recipe through
#    steering headers listed below.  It forms a list of arcs stored in
#    the group user headers ARCS_LIST.

# Steering Headers:

#       The name of the arc for a given filter, slit and grating name,
#       and the corresponding number of frames used to create it.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for ESO infra-red spectrometers.
#    -  Processing only occurs for arc frames.
#    -  The arc names are specified by _GET_ARC_NAME_.
