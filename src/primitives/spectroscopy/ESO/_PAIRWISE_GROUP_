# Name:
#    _PAIRWISE_GROUP_ 
#
# Purpose:
#    Creates a group file from reduced single frames taken in a pairwise
#    sequence.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive takes reduced single frames taken in a pairwise sequence,
#    and groups them to make a group file.  It coadds multiple exposures at
#    the same location to form a single pair of frames.  It then subtracts
#    the off-source beam frame from the on-source beam frame before
#    coadding into a group file.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This is an ESO variant, which coadds multiple exposures first
#    to make the normal single pair of frames.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes reduced single frames taken in a pairwise sequence,
and groups them to make a group file.  It coadds multiple exposures at
the same location to form a single pair of frames.  It then subtracts
the off-source beam frame from the on-source beam frame before
coadding into a group file.

=item *

This is an ESO variant, which coadds multiple exposures first
to make the normal single pair of frames.
