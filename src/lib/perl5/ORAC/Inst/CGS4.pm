=head1 NAME

ORAC::Inst::CGS4 - ORAC description of CGS4

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Inst::CGS4;

  %Mon = $inst->start_algorithm_engines;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module configures the system for the instrument. This primarily
involves configuring the messaging and algorithm engine environment
and is independent of the C<ORAC::Frame> definition.

Algorithm engine definitions can be found in C<ORAC::Inst::Defn>.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<start_algorithm_engines>

Starts the algorithm engines and returns a hash containing
the objects associated with each monolith.
The routine returns when all the last monolith can be contacted
(so requires that messaging has been initialised before this
routine is called).

CGS4 uses KAPPA (kappa_mon), FIGARO and CCDPACK.

sub start_algorithm_engines {

  my $self = shift;

  # Retrieve algorithm requirements
  my @engines = orac_determine_initial_algorithm_engines( 'CGS4' );

  # Now launch them
  return $self->_launch_algorithm_engines( @engines );

}

=item B<return_possible_calibrations>

Returns an array containing a list of the possible calibrations
for this instrument.

  my $self = shift;
  return ( "arc", "bias", "dark", "flat", "mask", "sky", "standard", "badobs", "profile", "readnoise", "row" );
