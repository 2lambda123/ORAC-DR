=head1 NAME

ORAC::Inst::SCUBA2 - ORAC description of SCUBA-2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Inst::SCUBA2;

  $inst = new ORAC::Inst::SCUBA2;

  %Mon = $inst->start_algorithm_engines;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module configures the system for the instrument. This primarily
involves configuring the messaging and algorithm engine environment
and is independent of the C<ORAC::Frame> definition.

Algorithm engine definitions can be found in C<ORAC::Inst::Defn>.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<start_algorithm_engines>

Starts the algorithm engines and returns a hash containing the objects
associated with each monolith.  The routine returns when all the last
monolith can be contacted (so requires that messaging has been
initialised before this routine is called).

SCUBA-2 uses KAPPA (kapview_mon, kappa_mon, ndfpack_mon) and
CCDPACK.

=cut

sub start_algorithm_engines {
  my $self = shift;

  # Retrieve algorithm requirements
  my @engines = orac_determine_initial_algorithm_engines( 'SCUBA2' );

  # Now launch them
  return $self->_launch_algorithm_engines( @engines );

}

=item B<return_possible_calibrations>

Returns an array containing a list of the possible calibrations
for this instrument.

sub return_possible_calibrations {
  my $self = shift;
  return ( "gains", "tausys" );
