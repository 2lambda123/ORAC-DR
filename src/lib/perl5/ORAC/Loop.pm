=head1 NAME

ORAC::Loop - data loops for ORACDR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Loop;

  $frm = orac_loop_list($class, $utdate, \@list, $skip);

  $frm = orac_loop_inf($class, $utdate, \@list);

  $frm = orac_loop_wait($class, $utdate, \@list, $skip);

  $frm = orac_loop_flag($class, $utdate, \@list, $skip);
  
  $frm = orac_loop_file($class, \@list );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a set of loop handling routines for ORACDR.
Each subroutine accepts the same arguments and returns the current
observation number (or undef if there was an error or if the loop
should be terminated).

A new  Frame object is returned of class $class that has been configured
for the new file (ie a C<$Frm-E<gt>configure> method has been run)

It is intended that this routine is called inside an infinite while
loop with the same @list array. This array is modified by the loop
routines so that they can keep track of the 'next' frame number.

If a filename can not be found (eg it doesnt exist or the list has
been processed) undef is returned.

The skip flag is used to indicate whether the loop should skip
forward if the current observation number can not be found
but a higher numbered observation is present. Currently no loops
will go back to missing observations if they appear after a higher
number (eg observation 10 appears before observation 9!)

=head1 LOOP SUBROUTINES

The following loop facilities are available:

=over 4


=item B<orac_loop_list>

Takes a list of numbers and returns back a frame object 
for each number (one frame object per call)

  $Frm = orac_loop_list($class, $UT, \@array, $noskip);

undef is returned on error or when all members of the
list have been returned. If the 'skip' flag is true
missing files in the list will be ignored and the next
element of the list selected. If 'skip' is false
the loop will abort if the file is not present

  my $obsno;
  my $TestFrm = $class->new() if $skip; # Dummy Frame for file check

  # Shift files off the array until we get one that exists
  # or until we get to the end of the array [ie an undefined value]
  # If we dont worry about missing observations we immediately
  # jump out of the loop (ie just read the array once).
  # If we do care about the existence of the file we have to check
  # for the input file (-e) and loop round again if it isn't there.

  while (defined ($obsno = shift(@$obsref))) {

    # If we dont care whether the file is there or not (ie default mode)
    # we jump out of the loop immediately and rely on the link_and_read
    # routine to abort the main loop for us (by returning undef)
    last unless $skip;

    # Ok - we are interested in finding out whether the file is there
    # or not. There is a slight overhead here in that we have to
    # do the -e test twice for any successful file. Once here and
    # once again in link_and_read -- presumably I could have a variant
    # on link_and_read that gets passed the file name directly
    # on the understanding that the file is there but for now
    # I will just do the -e in both places. Note that this relies
    # on the file being present in ORAC_DATA_IN. It will not look
    # in ORAC_DATA_OUT first (eg after a FITS conversion)
    # At some point we need to merge the link_and_read with this
    # so that this routine has the same robustness as link_and_read.

  # If obsno is undef return undef
  return undef unless defined $obsno;

  my $Frm = link_and_read($class, $utdate, $obsno, 0);

  # Return frame
  return $Frm;

}

=item B<orac_loop_inf>

Checks for the frame stored in the first element of the supplied array
and returns the Frame object if the file exists. The number is incremented
such that the next observation is returned next time the routine is
called.

  $Frm = orac_loop_inf($class, $ut, \@array);

undef is returned on error or when there are no more data files
available.

This loop does not have a facility for skipping files when observations
are not present. This behaviour is obtained by combining 
orac_check_data_dir with the list looping option so that the last
observation number can be determined before running the loop. The skip
flag is ignored in this loop.

}

=item B<orac_loop_wait>

Waits for the specified file to appear in the directory.
A timeout of 60 minutes is hard-wired in initially -- undef
is returned if the timeout is exceeded.

  $frm = orac_loop_wait($class, $utdate, \@list, $skip);

The first member of the array is used to keep track of the
current observation number. This element is incremented so that
the following observation is returned when the routine is called
subsequently. This means that this loop is similar to using the
'-from' option in conjunction with the 'inf' loop except that
new data is expected.

The loop will return undef (i.e. terminate looping) if the
supplied array contains undef in the first entry.

The skip flag is used to indicate whether the loop should skip
forward if the current observation number can not be found
but a higher numbered observation is present.

If no data can be found, the directory is scanned every few seconds
(hard-wired into the routine). A dot is printed to the screen after
a specified number of scans (default is 1 dot per scan and one scan every
2 seconds).

=item B<orac_check_data_dir>

Routine to check the input data directory (ORAC_DATA_IN) for
files in order to see whether files exist with a higher number
than the supplied number. The routine is supplied with a class name,
UT date and current observation number. An additional argument
is provided to determine whether data files or flag files should
be used for the directory search.

   $next = orac_check_data_dir($class, $current, $flag);
   ($next, $high) = orac_check_data_dir($class, $current, $flag);

If called in a scalar context, the return argument is the next
observation in the sequence. If called in an array context, two
arguments are returned: the next observation number and the highest
observation number.

undef (or undef,undef) is returned if no higher observations can be
found. If it is necessary to check for the existence of current
file as well (eg via a data detection loop) then simply decrement the
supplied argument by 1.

This routine is used in conjunction with the -from loop (where we
dont know the end) and the waiting loops where we are not sure whether
new data have been written to disk but missing the next observation.

This routine does NOT look in ORAC_DATA_OUT.

A global variables (@LIST) is used to speed up the sorting by storing
a list of observation numbers that have previously been shown to have a lower
number than required (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED).

=head1 PRIVATE SUBROUTINES

The following subroutines are not exported.

=over 4

=item B<link_and_read>

General subroutine for converting ut and number into file
and creating a Frame object.

  $frm = link_and_read($class, $ut, $obsnum, $flag)

The four parameters are:

=item class - class of Frame object

=item ut - UT date in YYYYMMDD

=item obsnum - observation number

=item flag - if filename(s) is to come from flag file

undef is returned on error.
A configured Frame object is returned if everything is okay

Pause the checking for new data files by the specified number of seconds.

Where $pause is the number of seconds to wait and $time is the number
of seconds actually waited (see the sleep() command for more details).

If the Tk system is loaded this routine will actually do a Tk event loop
for the required number of seconds. This is so that the X screen will
be refreshed. Currently the only test is the Tk is loaded, not that
we are actually using Tk.....
