=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item B<getVersion>

Uses the $ORAC_DIR environment variable and the svnversion command
to determine the site-wide version number string.

 $version = ORAC::Version->getVersion();

If a file called C<.version> is present in $ORAC_DIR it is assumed
to contain the global version number. If not present the svnversion
command will be run to determine the state of the source code checkout
tree. If $ORAC_DIR refers to an exported tree then the version will
be "UNKNOWN".

Note that if the source code tree has been locally modified the
version string will not be a single number.

The value is cached (and assumes that once calculated it will not
change during runtime).
