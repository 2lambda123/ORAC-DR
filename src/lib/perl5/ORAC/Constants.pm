=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Constants;
  use ORAC::Constants qw/ORAC__OK/;
  use ORAC::Constants qw/:status/;

=cut

use strict;
use warnings;

use vars qw/ $VERSION @ISA %EXPORT_TAGS @EXPORT_OK/;
'$Revision$ ' =~ /.*:\s(.*)\s\$/ && ($VERSION = $1);

require Exporter;

@ISA = qw/Exporter/;

@EXPORT_OK = qw/ORAC__OK ORAC__ERROR ORAC__BADENG
                ORAC__ABORT ORAC__FATAL ORAC__PARSE_ERROR/;

%EXPORT_TAGS = (
		'status'=>[qw/ ORAC__OK ORAC__ERROR ORAC__BADENG
		               ORAC__ABORT ORAC__FATAL ORAC__PARSE_ERROR/]
	       );

Exporter::export_tags('status');

=head1 CONSTANTS

The following constants are available from this module:

=over 4

=item B<ORAC__OK>

This constant contains the definition of good ORAC status.

=cut

use constant ORAC__OK => 0;


=item B<ORAC__ERROR>

This constant contains the definition of bad ORAC status.

=cut

use constant ORAC__ERROR => -1;

# Did want to try implementing constants like this but
# is easier to use the constant module.
# *ORAC__OK = \0;

=item B<ORAC__BADENG>

An algorithm engine has returned with a status that indicates
that the engine is no longer valid. This can be used to
indicate that an engine has crashed and that a new one should be
launched.

=cut

use constant ORAC__BADENG => 2;

=item B<ORAC__ABORT>

This constant contains the definition a user aborted ORAC process

=cut

use constant ORAC__ABORT => -2;

=item B<ORAC__FATAL>

This constant contains the definition an ORAC process which has died fatally

=cut

use constant ORAC__FATAL => -3;

=item B<ORAC__PARSE_ERROR>

This constant contains the definition of an error in parsing a recipe.

=cut

use constant ORAC__PARSE_ERROR => -4;

=head1 TAGS

Individual sets of constants can be imported by 
including the module with tags. For example:

  use ORAC::Constants qw/:status/;

will import all constants associated with ORAC status checking.

The available tags are:

=over 4

=item :status

Constants associated with ORAC status checking: ORAC__OK and ORAC__ERROR.

=back

=head1 USAGE

The constants can be used as if they are subroutines.
For example, if I want to print the value of ORAC__ERROR I can

  use ORAC::Constants;
  print ORAC__ERROR;

or

  use ORAC::Constants ();
  print ORAC::Constants::ORAC__ERROR;
