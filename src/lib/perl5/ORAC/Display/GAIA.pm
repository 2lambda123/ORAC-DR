=head1 NAME

ORAC::Display::GAIA - ORAC interface to GAIA

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $disp = new ORAC::Display::GAIA;

  $disp->image($file);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ORAC interface to the the GAIA (ESO Skycat) display tool. Provides methods
for displaying images.

Available options are:

IMAGE - display image in GAIA window

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Object constructor. The constructor starts up a new version of
GAIA (if one is not running) and connects via a socket.

The program aborts if there is an error launching or contacting
gaia.

=cut

  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  # Dont allow any arguments.
  # Probably should turn off -w here

=head2 Accessor Methods

=over 4

=item B<launchable>

Whether or not GAIA can be automatically launched.

  $gaia->launchable( 0 );

Defaults to true. If this is set to false (0), then a new GAIA will
never be started.

=cut

sub launchable {
  my $self = shift;
  if( @_ ) { $self->{Launchable} = shift; }
  return $self->{Launchable};
}

=item B<sock>

Returns or sets the socket to Gaia. Private to this class.

  $sock = $gaia->sock();

This is usually IO::Socket object. This socket is automatically
added to the IO::Select object returned by the C<sel> method.
(and all previous sockets registered with the IO::Select object
are removed).

=cut

sub sock {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    # Read the socket
    $self->{Sock} = shift;
    # Clear all previous entries from the IO::Select object
    $self->sel->remove( $self->sel->handles );

    # Add this socket to the IO::Select object
    $self->sel->add( $self->{Sock} );
  }
  return $self->{Sock};
}

=item B<sel>

Returns the IO::Select object associated associated with the
current socket.

  $select = $gaia->sel();

This object is used to determine whether the GAIA process can be
contacted through the established socket connection.

=cut

sub sel {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->{Sel};
}

=item B<use_remote_gaia>

Controls whether we are allowed to connect to a GAIA process that
is already running on a remote machine. By default this is allowed
(true) but in some cases you may not want to connect to a remote
GAIA. For example, at UKIRT, the display must be sent to the machine
running the pipeline and not one of the other GAIAs that are running
on separate machines for QuickLook and general data inspection.

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<create_dev>

Clone a new GAIA window and associate it with 'win'. This is different
to launching a new display device (ie running up GAIA itself).

  $status = $Display->create_dev($win, $name);

For GAIA (V E<lt>= 2.3-2) the device name ($name) must be an integer.
(enforced if the newdev() method is used).

ORAC status is returned.

  # work correctly so we must name them explicitly. Integers are expected.

}




=item B<launch>

Connect to a pre-existing Gaia process or launch a new Gaia process.
If the first connection attempt fails, launches a new gaia process.
After this, attempts to connect to a new gaia process every 3 seconds
and attempts to launch a new gaia process every 60 seconds.
A maximum of 5 attempts are made (5 minutes) to launch a new Gaia
process before giving up.

There is no return status -- the program croaks if it can not
get a connection to GAIA !!

Whilst it is waiting, does not attempt to keep a L<Tk|Tk> event loop
running.

=head1 DISPLAY METHODS

=over 4

=item B<image>

Routine to display images in Gaia. Note that the full file name is required.
If an image name does not include an extension then '.sdf' is appended.
(ie NDF is assumed).

Takes a file name and arguments stored in a hash.

  $disp->image("filename", \%options)
  $disp->image("filename", { WINDOW => 2 });

Currently no image sectioning is supported.
Display range can be adjusted with ZAUTOSCALE, ZMIN and ZMAX.

Component can be selected with COMP option. DATA is the default.
QUALITY and VARIANCE are supported.

Note that for GAIA, ZAUTOSCALE implies a 95 percent cut level and
not 100 percent.

Will attempt to relaunch GAIA if it can not be contacted.
Will attempt to create a new clone window if a clone can not be
contacted even though it has been used previously.

ORAC status is returned.
