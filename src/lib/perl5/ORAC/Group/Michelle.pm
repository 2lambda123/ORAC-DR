package ORAC::Group::Michelle;

=head1 NAME

ORAC::Group::Michelle - Michelle class for dealing with observation groups in ORAC-DR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Group;

  $Grp = new ORAC::Group::Michelle("group1");
  $Grp->file("group_file")
  $Grp->readhdr;
  $value = $Grp->hdr("KEYWORD");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods for handling group objects that
are specific to Michelle. It provides a class derived from B<ORAC::Group::NDF>.
All the methods available to B<ORAC::Group> objects are available
to B<ORAC::Group::Michelle> objects.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class in addition to
those available from B<ORAC::Group>.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a B<ORAC::Group::Michelle> object.
This method takes an optional argument containing the
name of the new group. The object identifier is returned.

   $Grp = new ORAC::Group::Michelle;
   $Grp = new ORAC::Group::Michelle("group_name");

This method calls the base class constructor but initialises
the group with a file suffix of '.sdf' and a fixed part
of 'rg'.

=cut

sub new {
  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  # Do not pass objects if the constructor required
  # knowledge of fixedpart() and filesuffix()
  my $group = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

  # Configure it
  $group->fixedpart('gm');
  $group->filesuffix('.sdf');

  # return the new object
  return $group;
}

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<calc_orac_headers>

This method calculates header values that are required by the
pipeline by using values stored in the header.

Required ORAC extensions are:

ORACTIME: should be set to a decimal time that can be used for
comparing the relative start times of frames. For IRCAM this
number is decimal hours, for SCUBA this number is decimal
UT days.

ORACUT: This is the UT day of the frame in YYYYMMDD format.

This method should be run after a header is set. Currently the readhdr()
method calls this whenever it is updated.

This method updates the frame header.
Returns a hash containing the new keywords.

=cut

sub calc_orac_headers {
  my $self = shift;

  my %new = ();  # Hash containing the derived headers

  # ORACTIME
  # For IRCAM the keyword is simply RUTSTART
  # Just return it (zero if not available)
  my $time = $self->hdr('RUTSTART');
  $time = 0 unless (defined $time);
  $self->hdr('ORACTIME', $time);

  $new{'ORACTIME'} = $time;

  # ORACUT
  # For IRCAM this is simply the IDATE header value
  my $ut = $self->hdr('IDATE');
  $ut = 0 unless defined $ut;
  $self->hdr('ORACUT', $ut);

  return %new;
}
