=head1 NAME

ORAC::Group::WFCAM - class for dealing with WFCAM observation groups in ORAC-DR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Group::WFCAM;

  $Grp = new ORAC::Group::WFCAM("group1");
  $Grp->file("group_file")
  $Grp->readhdr;
  $value = $Grp->hdr("KEYWORD");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods for handling group objects that
are specific to WFCAM. It provides a class derived from B<ORAC::Group::UFTI>.
All the methods available to ORAC::Group objects are available
to B<ORAC::Group::WFCAM> objects.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class in addition to
those available from ORAC::Group.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a B<ORAC::Group::WFCAM> object.
This method takes an optional argument containing the
name of the new group. The object identifier is returned.

   $Grp = new ORAC::Group::WFCAM;
   $Grp = new ORAC::Group::WFCAM("group_name");

This method calls the base class constructor but initialises
the group with a file suffix of '.sdf' and a fixed part
of 'g'.

=cut

sub new {
  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

# Do not pass objects if the constructor required knowledge
# of fixedpart() and filesuffix()
  my $group = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

# Which WFCAM chip is this? We need to know so we know what
# to call the group file.
  my $fixedpart;
  if( $ENV{'ORAC_INSTRUMENT'} =~ /^WFCAM([1-5])$/ ) {
    $fixedpart = $groupfixedpart{$1};
  } else {
    $fixedpart = $groupfixedpart{'1'};
  }

# Configure the object.
  $group->fixedpart($fixedpart);
  $group->filesuffix('.sdf');

# And return the new object.
  return $group;
}
