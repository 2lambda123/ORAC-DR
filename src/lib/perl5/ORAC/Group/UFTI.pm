=head1 NAME

ORAC::Group::UFTI - class for dealing with UFTI observation groups in ORAC-DR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Group::UFTI;

  $Grp = new ORAC::Group::UFTI("group1");
  $Grp->file("group_file")
  $Grp->readhdr;
  $value = $Grp->hdr("KEYWORD");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods for handling group objects that
are specific to UFTI. It provides a class derived from B<ORAC::Group::NDF>.
All the methods available to ORAC::Group objects are available
to B<ORAC::Group::UFTI> objects.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class in addition to
those available from ORAC::Group.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a B<ORAC::Group::UFTI> object.
This method takes an optional argument containing the
name of the new group. The object identifier is returned.

   $Grp = new ORAC::Group::UFTI;
   $Grp = new ORAC::Group::UFTI("group_name");

This method calls the base class constructor but initialises
the group with a file suffix of '.sdf' and a fixed part
of 'g'.

=cut

sub new {
  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  # Do not pass objects if the constructor required
  # knowledge of fixedpart() and filesuffix()
  my $group = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

  # Configure it
  $group->fixedpart('gf');
  $group->filesuffix('.sdf');

  # return the new object
  return $group;
}
