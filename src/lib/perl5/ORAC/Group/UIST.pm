=head1 NAME

ORAC::Group::UIST - UIST class for dealing with observation groups in ORAC-DR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Group;

  $Grp = new ORAC::Group::UIST("group1");
  $Grp->file("group_file")
  $Grp->readhdr;
  $value = $Grp->hdr("KEYWORD");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods for handling group objects that
are specific to UIST. It provides a class derived from B<ORAC::Group::NDF>.
All the methods available to B<ORAC::Group> objects are available
to B<ORAC::Group::UIST> objects.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class in addition to
those available from B<ORAC::Group>.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a B<ORAC::Group::UIST> object.
This method takes an optional argument containing the
name of the new group. The object identifier is returned.

   $Grp = new ORAC::Group::UIST;
   $Grp = new ORAC::Group::UIST("group_name");

This method calls the base class constructor but initialises
the group with a file suffix of '.sdf' and a fixed part
of 'rg'.

=cut

sub new {
  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  # Do not pass objects if the constructor required
  # knowledge of fixedpart() and filesuffix()
  my $group = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

  # Configure it
  $group->fixedpart('gu');
  $group->filesuffix('.sdf');

  # return the new object
  return $group;
}

=back

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<calc_orac_headers>

This method calculates header values that are required by the
pipeline by using values stored in the header.

Required ORAC extensions are:

ORACTIME: should be set to a decimal time that can be used for
comparing the relative start times of frames.  For UIST this
is decimal UT days.

ORACUT: This is the UT day of the frame in YYYYMMDD format.

ORACDATETIME: This is the UT date in ISO8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.

This method should be run after a header is set. Currently the readhdr()
method calls this whenever it is updated.

This method updates the frame header.
Returns a hash containing the new keywords.

=cut

sub calc_orac_headers {
  my $self = shift;

  # Run the base class first since that does the ORAC
  # headers
  my %new = $self->SUPER::calc_orac_headers;

  # Grab the UT datetime from the DATE-OBS header.
  my $dateobs = defined( $self->hdr->{1}->{'DATE-OBS'}) ? $self->hdr->{1}->{'DATE-OBS'} : ( defined($self->hdr->{'DATE-OBS'}) ? $self->hdr->{'DATE-OBS'} : 0 );

  # Split it into its constituent components.
  $dateobs =~ /^(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)T(\d\d):(\d\d):(\d\d)/;
  my $year = $1;
  my $month = $2;
  my $day = $3;
  my $hour = $4;
  my $minute = $5;
  my $second = $6;

  # Now set ORACTIME to be decimal UT date.
  my $date = $year . $month . $day;
  my $time = $hour / 24 + ( $minute / ( 24 * 60 ) ) + ( $second / ( 24 * 60 * 60 ) );

  $self->hdr('ORACTIME', $date + $time);

  $new{'ORACTIME'} = $date + $time;

  # ORACUT is just $date.
  $self->hdr('ORACUT', $date );
  $new{'ORACUT'} = $date;

  # And set up the ORACDATETIME header too.
  $dateobs =~ s/Z//g;
  $self->hdr( 'ORACDATETIME', $dateobs );
  $new{'ORACDATETIME'} = $dateobs;

  return %new;
