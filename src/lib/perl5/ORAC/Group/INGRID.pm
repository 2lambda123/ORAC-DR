=head1 NAME

ORAC::Group::INGRID - INGRID class for dealing with observation groups in ORAC-DR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Group;

  $Grp = new ORAC::Group::INGRID("group1");
  $Grp->file("group_file")
  $Grp->readhdr;
  $value = $Grp->hdr("KEYWORD");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods for handling group objects that
are specific to INGRID. It provides a class derived from B<ORAC::Group::NDF>.
All the methods available to B<ORAC::Group> objects are available
to B<ORAC::Group::INGRID> objects.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class in addition to
those available from B<ORAC::Group>.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a B<ORAC::Group::INGRID> object.
This method takes an optional argument containing the
name of the new group. The object identifier is returned.

   $Grp = new ORAC::Group::INGRID;
   $Grp = new ORAC::Group::INGRID("group_name");

This method calls the base class constructor but initialises
the group with a file suffix of '.sdf' and a fixed part
of 'gingrid'.

=cut

sub new {
   my $proto = shift;
   my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

# Do not pass objects if the constructor required knowledge of
# fixedpart() and filesuffix() methods.
   my $group = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

# Configure it.
   $group->fixedpart( 'gingrid' );
   $group->filesuffix( '.sdf' );

# Eeturn the new object.
   return $group;
}
