=head1 NAME

ORAC::Group::ACSIS - ACSIS class for dealing with observation groups in ORAC-DR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Group;

  $Grp = new ORAC::Group::ACSIS("group1");
  $Grp->file("group_file")
  $Grp->readhdr;
  $value = $Grp->hdr("KEYWORD");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods for handling group objects that
are specific to ACSIS. It provides a class derived from B<ORAC::Group::NDF>.
All the methods available to B<ORAC::Group> objects are available
to B<ORAC::Group::ACSIS> objects.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class in addition to
those available from B<ORAC::Group>.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of an B<ORAC::Group::ACSIS> object. This method
takes an optional argument containing the name of the new group.
The object identifier is returned.

  $Grp = new ORAC::Group::ACSIS;
  $Grp = new ORAC::Group::ACSIS("group_name");

This method calls the base class constructor but initialises the group
with a file suffix if ".sdf" and a fixed part of "ga".

=cut

sub new {
  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref( $proto ) || $proto;

# Do not pass objects if the constructor required
# knowledge of fixedpart() and filesuffix().
  my $group = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

# Configure it.
  $group->fixedpart('ga');
  $group->filesuffix('.sdf');

# And return the new object.
  return $group;
}

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<file_from_bits>

Method to return the group filename derived from a fixed
variable part (eg UT) and a group designator (usually obs
number). The full filename is returned (including suffix).

  $file = $Grp->file_from_bits("UT","num","extra");

For ACSIS the return string is of the format

  fixedpart . prefix . '_' . number . '_' . extra . suffix

=cut

sub file_from_bits {
  my $self = shift;

  my $prefix = shift;
  my $num = shift;
  my $extra = shift;

  # Follow UKIRT style
  return $self->fixedpart . $prefix . '_' . $num . '_' . $extra . $self->filesuffix;
}

=item B<inout>

Similar to base class except the frame number is appended to the
output suffix. The frame number is padded with zeroes to make it three
digits long.

=cut

sub inout {
  my $self = shift;
  my $suffix = shift;
  my $number = shift;
  if (defined $number) {
    $suffix .= sprintf( "%03d", $number );

  }
  return $self->SUPER::inout( $suffix, (defined $number ? $number : () ) );

}
