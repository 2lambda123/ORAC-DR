=head1 NAME

ORAC::Frame::PICARD - Class for handling individual reduced data files via PICARD

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Frame::PICARD;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods for handling Frame objects that are
derived from standalone data products suitable for processing with
PICARD. Each input file corresponds to a single frame.

=cut

use 5.006;
use warnings;
use vars qw/$VERSION/;

# Let the object know that it is derived from ORAC::Frame::NDF;
use base qw/ORAC::Frame::NDF/;

# standard error module and turn on strict
use Carp;
use strict;

$VERSION = sprintf("%d", q$Revision: 7007 $ =~ /(\d+)/);

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class in addition to
those available from B<ORAC::Frame::NDF>.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Simple constructor. 

  $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::PICARD( \@files );

=cut

sub new {
  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  # Run the base class constructor with a hash reference
  # defining additions to the class
  # Do not supply user-arguments yet.
  # This is because if we do run configure via the constructor
  # the rawfixedpart and rawsuffix will be undefined.
  my $self = $class->SUPER::new();

  # Configure initial state - could pass these in with
  # the class initialisation hash - this assumes that I know
  # the hash member name
  $self->rawformat('NDF');
  $self->format('NDF');

  # If arguments are supplied then we can configure the object.
  # Currently the argument will be the array reference to the list
  # of filenames, or if there are two args it's the UT date and
  # observation number.
  $self->configure(@_) if @_;

  return $self;
}
