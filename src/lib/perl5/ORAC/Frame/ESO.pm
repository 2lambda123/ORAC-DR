=head1 NAME

ORAC::Frame::ESO - ESO class for dealing with observation files in ORAC-DR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Frame::ESO;

  $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::ESO("filename");
  $Frm->file("file")
  $Frm->readhdr;
  $Frm->configure;
  $value = $Frm->hdr("KEYWORD");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods for handling Frame objects that are
specific to ESO. It provides a class derived from
B<ORAC::Frame::UKIRT>.  All the methods available to B<ORAC::Frame::UKIRT>
objects are available to B<ORAC::Frame::ESO> objects.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class in addition to
those available from ORAC::Frame.

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=cut

# Supply a method to return the number associated with the observation

=item B<number>

Method to return the number of the observation. The number is
determined by looking for a number at the end of the raw data
filename.  For example a number can be extracted from strings of the
form textNNNN.sdf or textNNNN, where NNNN is a number (leading zeroes
are stripped) but not textNNNNtext (number must be followed by a decimal
point or nothing at all).

  $number = $Frm->number;

The return value is -1 if no number can be determined.

As an aside, an alternative approach for this method (especially
in a sub-class) would be to read the number from the header.

=cut


sub number {

  my $self = shift;

  my ($number);

  # Get the number from the raw data
  # Assume there is a number at the end of the string
  # (since the extension has already been removed)
  # Leading zeroes are dropped

  my $raw = $self->raw;
  if ( defined $raw && ref( $raw ) eq "ARRAY" ) {
     my @raws = @{$raw};
     $raw = $raws[ 0 ];
  }
  if (defined $raw && $raw =~ /(\d+)(\.\w+)?$/) {
    # Drop leading 00
    $number = $1 * 1;
  } else {
    # No match so set to -1
    $number = -1;
  }

  return $number;
