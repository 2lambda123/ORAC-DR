=head1 NAME

ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2 - SCUBA-2 class for dealing with observation files in ORACDR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2;

  $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2("filename");
  $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2(@files);
  $Frm->file("file")
  $Frm->readhdr;

  $value = $Frm->hdr("KEYWORD");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods for handling Frame objects that
are specific to SCUBA-2. It provides a class derived from B<ORAC::Frame>.
All the methods available to B<ORAC::Frame> objects are available
to B<ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2> objects. Some additional methods are supplied.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following are modifications to standard ORAC::Frame methods.

=head2 Constructors

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a B<ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2> object.  This method
also takes optional arguments: if 1 argument is supplied it is assumed
to be the name of the raw file associated with the observation but if
a reference to an array is supplied, each file listed in the array is
used. If 2 arguments are supplied they are assumed to be the raw file
prefix and observation number. In any case, all arguments are passed
to the configure() method which is run in addition to new() when
arguments are supplied.  The object identifier is returned.

   $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2;
   $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2("file_name");
   $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2(\@files);
   $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2("UT","number");

This method runs the base class constructor and then modifies
the rawsuffix and rawfixedpart to be '.sdf' and 's4' or 's8'
(depending on instrument designation) respectively.

=cut

sub new {

  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  # Run the base class constructor with a hash reference
  # defining additions to the class
  # Do not supply user-arguments yet.
  # This is because if we do run configure via the constructor
  # the rawfixedpart and rawsuffix will be undefined.
  my $self = $class->SUPER::new();

  # Configure initial state - could pass these in with
  # the class initialisation hash - this assumes that I know
  # the hash member name
  $self->rawfixedpart('s' . $self->_wavelength_prefix );
  $self->rawsuffix('.sdf');
  $self->rawformat('NDF');
  $self->format('NDF');

  # If arguments are supplied then we can configure the object
  # Currently the argument will be the filename.
  # If there are two args this becomes a prefix and number
  $self->configure(@_) if @_;

  return $self;
}

=head2 Subclassed methods

The following methods are provided for manipulating
B<ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2> objects. These methods override those
provided by B<ORAC::Frame>.

=over 4

=item B<calc_orac_headers>

This method calculates header values that are required by the
pipeline by using values stored in the header.

=cut

  return %new;

}

=item B<configure>

Configure the frame object. Usually called from the constructor.

Can be called either with a single filename or a reference to an
array of filenames

  $Frm->configure( $file );

=item B<data_detection_tasks>

Returns the names of the DRAMA tasks that should be queried for new
raw data.

  @tasks = $Frm->data_detection_tasks();

These tasks must be registered with the C<ORAC::Inst::Defn> module.

The task list can be overridden using the $ORAC_REMOTE_TASK
environment variable.

=item B<file_from_bits>

Determine the raw data filename given the variable component
parts. A prefix (usually UT) and observation number should
be supplied.

  $fname = $Frm->file_from_bits($prefix, $obsnum);

Not implemented for SCUBA-2 because of the multiple files
that can be associated with a particular UT date and observation number:
the multiple sub-arrays (a to d) and the multiple subscans.

=cut

sub file_from_bits {
  my $self = shift;
  croak "file_from_bits Method not supported since the number of files per observation is not predictable.\n";
}

=item B<pattern_from_bits>

Determine the pattern for the raw filename given the variable component
parts. A prefix (usually UT) and observation number should be supplied.

  $pattern = $Frm->pattern_from_bits( $prefix, $obsnum );

Returns a regular expression object.

=cut

     $padnum . '_\d\d\d\d\d' . $self->rawsuffix;

  return qr/$pattern/;
}


=item B<flag_from_bits>

Determine the flag filename given the variable component
parts. A prefix (usually UT) and observation number should
be supplied.

  @fnames = $Frm->file_from_bits($prefix, $obsnum);

Returns multiple file names (one for each array) and
throws an exception if called in a scalar context. The filename
returned will include the path relative to ORAC_DATA_IN, where
ORAC_DATA_IN is the directory containing the flag files.

The format is "swxYYYYMMDD_NNNNN.ok", where "w" is the wavelength
signifier ('8' for 850 or '4' for 450) and "x" a letter from
'a' to 'd'.

=cut

  my $self = shift;

  my $prefix = shift;

  my @flags = map {
    $fixed . $_ . $prefix . "_$padnum" . ".ok"
  } ( $self->_dacodes );

  # SCUBA naming
  return @flags;
}

=item B<findgroup>

Return the group associated with the Frame. This group is constructed
from header information. The group name is automatically updated in
the object via the group() method.

=cut

# Supply a new method for finding a group

sub findgroup {

  my $self = shift;
  my $group;


  if (exists $self->hdr->{DRGROUP} && $self->hdr->{DRGROUP} ne 'UNKNOWN'

#      $self->hdr('OBJECT');
    $group = "1";
  }

  # Update $group
  $self->group($group);

  return $group;
}


=item B<findnsubs>

Forces the object to determine the number of sub-frames
associated with the data by looking in the header (hdr()). 
The result is stored in the object using nsubs().


Unlike findgroup() this method will always search the header for
the current state.

=cut

sub findnsubs {
  my $self = shift;
  my @files = $self->raw;
  my $nsubs = scalar( @files );
  $self->nsubs( $nsubs );
  return $nsubs;

=item B<findrecipe>

Return the recipe associated with the frame.  The state of the object
is automatically updated via the recipe() method.

=cut

sub findrecipe {
  my $self = shift;

  my $recipe = undef;
  my $mode = $self->hdr('MODE');

  # Check for DRRECIPE. Have to make sure it contains something (anything)
  # other thant UNKNOWN.
  if (exists $self->hdr->{DRRECIPE} && $self->hdr->{DRRECIPE} ne 'UNKNOWN'

Some SCUBA-2 data files include processed images (specifically, DREAM

to the time series.

are present.
