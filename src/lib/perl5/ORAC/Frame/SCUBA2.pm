=head1 NAME

ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2 - SCUBA-2 class for dealing with observation files in ORACDR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2;

  $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2("filename");
  $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2(@files);
  $Frm->file("file")
  $Frm->readhdr;

  $value = $Frm->hdr("KEYWORD");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods for handling Frame objects that
are specific to SCUBA-2. It provides a class derived from B<ORAC::Frame>.
All the methods available to B<ORAC::Frame> objects are available
to B<ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2> objects. Some additional methods are supplied.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following are modifications to standard ORAC::Frame methods.

=head2 Constructors

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a B<ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2> object.  This method
also takes optional arguments: if 1 argument is supplied it is assumed
to be the name of the raw file associated with the observation but if
a reference to an array is supplied, each file listed in the array is
used. If 2 arguments are supplied they are assumed to be the raw file
prefix and observation number. In any case, all arguments are passed
to the configure() method which is run in addition to new() when
arguments are supplied.  The object identifier is returned.

   $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2;
   $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2("file_name");
   $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2(\@files);
   $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2("UT","number");

This method runs the base class constructor and then modifies
the rawsuffix and rawfixedpart to be '.sdf' and 's4' or 's8'
(depending on instrument designation) respectively.

=cut

sub new {

  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  # Run the base class constructor with a hash reference
  # defining additions to the class
  # Do not supply user-arguments yet.
  # This is because if we do run configure via the constructor
  # the rawfixedpart and rawsuffix will be undefined.
  my $self = $class->SUPER::new();

  # Configure initial state - could pass these in with
  # the class initialisation hash - this assumes that I know
  # the hash member name
  $self->rawfixedpart('s' . $self->_wavelength_prefix );
  $self->rawsuffix('.sdf');
  $self->rawformat('NDF');
  $self->format('NDF');

  # If arguments are supplied then we can configure the object
  # Currently the argument will be the filename.
  # If there are two args this becomes a prefix and number
  $self->configure(@_) if @_;

=head2 Subclassed methods

The following methods are provided for manipulating
B<ORAC::Frame::SCUBA2> objects. These methods override those
provided by B<ORAC::Frame>.

Can be called either with a single filename or a reference to an
array of filenames

=item B<data_detection_tasks>

Returns the names of the DRAMA tasks that should be queried for new
raw data.

  @tasks = $Frm->data_detection_tasks();

These tasks must be registered with the C<ORAC::Inst::Defn> module.

The task list can be overridden using the $ORAC_REMOTE_TASK
environment variable.

=item B<framegroupkeys>

For SCUBA-2 a single frame object is returned in most cases. For focus
observations each focus position is returned as a separate Frame
object. This simplifies the recipes and allows the QL and standard
recipes to work in the same way.

Observation number is also kept separate in case the pipeline gets so
far behind that the system detects the end of one observation and the
start of the next.

 @keys = $Frm->framegroupkeys;

=cut

sub framegroupkeys {
  return (qw/ OBSNUM FOCPOSN /);
}


=item B<file_from_bits>

Determine the raw data filename given the variable component
parts. A prefix (usually UT) and observation number should
be supplied.

  $fname = $Frm->file_from_bits($prefix, $obsnum);

Not implemented for SCUBA-2 because of the multiple files
that can be associated with a particular UT date and observation number:
the multiple sub-arrays (a to d) and the multiple subscans.

=cut

sub file_from_bits {
  my $self = shift;
  croak "file_from_bits Method not supported since the number of files per observation is not predictable.\n";

=item B<file_from_bits_extra>

Method to return C<extra> information to be used in the file name. For
SCUBA-2 this is a string representing the wavelength.

  my $extra = $Frm->file_from_bits_extra;

=cut

sub file_from_bits_extra {
  my $self = shift;

  return ( $self->hdr("FILTER") =~ /^8/ ) ? "850" : "450";
}

=item B<pattern_from_bits>

Determine the pattern for the raw filename given the variable component
parts. A prefix (usually UT) and observation number should be supplied.

  $pattern = $Frm->pattern_from_bits( $prefix, $obsnum );

Returns a regular expression object.

=cut

sub pattern_from_bits {
  my $self = shift;

    $padnum . '_\d\d\d\d\d' . $self->rawsuffix;

  return qr/$pattern/;
}


=item B<number>

Method to return the number of the observation. The number is
determined by looking for a number after the UT date in the
filename. This method is subclassed for SCUBA-2 to deal with
SCUBA-2-specific filenames.

The return value is -1 if no number can be determined.

=cut

    }
  } else {
    # No match so set to -1.
    $number = -1;

=item B<flag_from_bits>

Determine the flag filename given the variable component
parts. A prefix (usually UT) and observation number should
be supplied.

  @fnames = $Frm->file_from_bits($prefix, $obsnum);

Returns multiple file names (one for each array) and
throws an exception if called in a scalar context. The filename
returned will include the path relative to ORAC_DATA_IN, where
ORAC_DATA_IN is the directory containing the flag files.

The format is "swxYYYYMMDD_NNNNN.ok", where "w" is the wavelength
signifier ('8' for 850 or '4' for 450) and "x" a letter from
'a' to 'd'.

=cut

=item B<findgroup>

Return the group associated with the Frame. This group is constructed
from header information. The group name is automatically updated in
the object via the group() method.

=cut

# Supply a new method for finding a group

sub findgroup {

  # Extra information required for group disambiguation
  my $extra = $self->hdr("FILTER" );

Return the recipe associated with the frame.  The state of the object
is automatically updated via the recipe() method.

=cut

sub findrecipe {
  my $self = shift;

  my $recipe = undef;
  my $mode = $self->hdr('SAM_MODE');

  # Check for RECIPE. Have to make sure it contains something (anything)

=item B<numsubarrays>

Return the number of subarrays in use. Works by checking for unique
subheaders and determining which of the abcd sub-arrays are producing
data. Only works once data are read in so ORAC-DR must have some other
way of knowing that there are n subarrays.

=cut

sub numsubarrays {
  my $self = shift;

  my @subs = $self->_dacodes;

  return scalar (@subs);
}

=item B<rewrite_outfile_subarray>

This method modifies the supplied filename to remove specific
subarray designation and replace it with a generic filter
designation.

Should be used when subarrays are merged into a single file.

If the s8a/s4a designation is missing the filename will be returned
unchanged.

  $outfile = $Frm->rewrite_outfile_subarray( $old_outfile );

The output file, or output HDS extension in a container, will be
removed by this routine. If no HDS container exists and it looks like
one will be required, it is created.

=item B<subarray>

Return the name of the subarray given either a filename or the index
into a Frame object. Takes a mandatory sole argument which is the file
index or name. If the Frame header has subheaders then the subarray is
obtained from the FITS header of the file and an entry is added to the
Frame uhdr. Returns undef if the FITS header could not be retrieved or
if no argument was given.

  my $subarray = $Frm->subarray( $i );

  $Frm->subarray( $file );

Works on the current frame only.

=item B<subarrays>

Return a list of the subarrays associated with the current Frame
object. Searches the subheaders for presence of SUBARRAY keyword which
will be present if data from multiple subarrays are stored in the
current Frame. If not found then just use the SUBARRAY entry in the
hdr.

Returns an array.

=item B<filter_darks>

Standard image-based DREAM and STARE processing has no need for dark
frames and so these should be filtered out as early as possible to
prevent weird errors. The translated header for the observation mode
is used. From this point on, no dark frames will be returned unless
the user accesses the raw data.

microns.

In scalar context returns a single string with the values concatenated.

=item B<_find_processed_images>

Some SCUBA-2 data files include processed images (specifically, DREAM
and STARE) that should be used as the pipeline input images in preference
to the time series.

This method takes a single file and returns the HDS hierarchy to these
images within the main frame. Returns empty list if no reduced images
are present.
