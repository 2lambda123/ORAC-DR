=head1 NAME

ORAC::Frame::UIST - UIST class for dealing with observation files in ORAC-DR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Frame::UIST;

  $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::UIST("filename");
  $Frm->file("file")
  $Frm->readhdr;
  $Frm->configure;
  $value = $Frm->hdr("KEYWORD");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods for handling Frame objects that are
specific to UIST. It provides a class derived from
B<ORAC::Frame::UKIRT>.  All the methods available to B<ORAC::Frame::UKIRT>
objects are available to B<ORAC::Frame::UIST> objects.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class in addition to
those available from ORAC::Frame.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a ORAC::Frame::UIST object.
This method also takes optional arguments:
if 1 argument is  supplied it is assumed to be the name
of the raw file associated with the observation. If 2 arguments
are supplied they are assumed to be the raw file prefix and
observation number. In any case, all arguments are passed to
the configure() method which is run in addition to new()
when arguments are supplied.
The object identifier is returned.

   $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::UIST;
   $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::UIST("file_name");
   $Frm = new ORAC::Frame::UIST("UT","number");

The constructor hard-wires the '.sdf' rawsuffix and the
'm' prefix although these can be overriden with the
rawsuffix() and rawfixedpart() methods.

sub new {

  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  # Run the base class constructor with a hash reference
  # defining additions to the class
  # Do not supply user-arguments yet.
  # This is because if we do run configure via the constructor
  # the rawfixedpart and rawsuffix will be undefined.
  my $self = $class->SUPER::new();

  # Configure initial state - could pass these in with
  # the class initialisation hash - this assumes that I know
  # the hash member name
  $self->rawfixedpart('u');
  $self->rawsuffix('.sdf');
#  $self->rawformat('UKIRTio');
  $self->rawformat('HDS');
  $self->format('HDS');

  # If arguments are supplied then we can configure the object
  # Currently the argument will be the filename.
  # If there are two args this becomes a prefix and number
  $self->configure(@_) if @_;

  return $self;
}
