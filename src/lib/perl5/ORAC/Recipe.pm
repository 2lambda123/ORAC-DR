=head1 METHODS

The following methods are available:

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

The constructor instantiates a new object and, if the recipe name and
instrument are given, reads the recipe from disk.

  $r = new ORAC::Recipe;
  $r = new ORAC::Recipe( NAME => $name,
                         INSTRUMENT => $instrument );

The instrument name is required in order to configure the recipe
search path.

=cut

sub new {

  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  # Init the data structure
  my $rec = bless {
                   BATCH => 0,

                   Recipe => undef,
                  }, $class;

  # Check for arguments
  my %args = @_;
  for my $key (keys %args) {
    my $method = lc( $key );

  }

  # if we have a name, frame and instrument we can proceed
  if (defined $rec->name && defined $rec->instrument && defined $rec->frame) {
    try {

    } catch ORAC::Error::FatalError with {

    };
  }

  return $rec;
}

=head2 Accessor Methods

=over 4

=item B<parser>

Recipe and primitive parser object used to do the real low level parsing.
Automatically instantiated on demand.

  $parser = $rec->parser();

Will be a C<ORAC::Recipe::PrimitiveParser>.

=cut

sub parser {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->{PrimitiveParser} = ORAC::Recipe::PrimitiveParser->new()
    unless defined $self->{PrimitiveParser};
  return $self->{PrimitiveParser};
}

=item B<recipe>

The actual recipe. Actually will be an C<ORAC::Recipe::Primitive>
object (since at the code level there is no difference).

 $data = $rec->recipe;

=cut

sub recipe {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    my $recipe = shift;
    if (defined $recipe) {
      throw ORAC::Error::FatalError("Must be an ORAC::Recipe::Primitive object")
        unless $recipe->isa("ORAC::Recipe::Primitive");
    }
    $self->{Recipe} = $recipe;
  }
  return $self->{Recipe};
}

=item B<name>

Recipe name. Will trigger a read of the recipe if an instrument is
available. If a compiled recipe is available the method will be delegated
to that object.

  $name = $rec->name;
  $rec->name( $name );

=cut

sub name {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    # we are setting a name
    $self->{RecipeName} = shift;

    # clear it

    # we can get (be pessimistic otherwise)

  # if we have a compiled recipe ask that
  if (defined $self->recipe) {
    return $self->recipe->name;
  } else {
    return $self->{RecipeName};
  }
}

=item B<batch>

Set or return the batch processing status. If batch is set to true 
the recipe will process groups that have been pre-populated with
unprocessed frames..

  $batch = $rec->batch;

=cut

sub batch {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{BATCH} = shift };
  return $self->{BATCH};
}

=item B<debug>

Set or return the debug status. If debug is set to true 
the processed recipe will include additional debug statements.

  $rec->debug(1);

=cut

# Delegate debugging to the Parser

sub debug {
  my $self = shift;
  my $parser = $self->parser();
  return $parser->debug(@_);
}

=item B<frame>

Set or return the C<ORAC::Frame> associated with the recipe execution.
This controls 

  $rec->frame($Frm);

=cut

# Delegate to the Parser

sub frame {
  my $self = shift;
  my $parser = $self->parser();
  return $parser->frame(@_);
}

=item B<instrument>

Set or return the instrument name. This is required to configure
search paths to determine recipe and primitive location.

  $inst = $rec->instrument;

If set, the parser object is updated automatically.

=cut

# Delegate to the Parser object since it does not really do us any
# good to have a scheme where they can differ

sub instrument {
  my $self = shift;
  my $parser = $self->parser();
  return $parser->instrument( @_ );
}

=item B<primitives>

Returns all the primitives that are referenced by this recipe.

 @prim = $rec->primitives;

=cut

sub primitives {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->_read_all_prims( 1 );
}

=back

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<check_syntax>

Loads and compiles each primitive in the recipe.

A Frame object may be required for some instruments.

  $rec->check_syntax;

Returns an array of all the primitives used by the recipe (in the order in which they
were loaded).

  @primitives = $rec->check_syntax;

=cut

sub check_syntax {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->_read_all_prims( 0 );
}

# Helper routine for check_syntax and primitives() methods.

  # now clean up the primitives list
  my @outprim;
  my %cache;

    next if exists $cache{$p};
    push(@outprim, $p);

    push(@primitives, $prim );
    push(@primitives, $self->_find_children( $child ));
  }
  return @primitives;
}


=item B<execute>

Executes the recipes stored in the object.
Also needs the current frame, group and calibration objects
as well as the hash containing all the messaging objects.

  $rec->execute( \$CURRENT_PRIMITIVE, \$PRIMITIVE_LIST, 
                 $Frm, $Grp, $Cal, $Display, \%Mon);

The following classes are avaiable to primitive writers:

  ORAC::Print, ORAC::LogFile, ORAC::General, ORAC::Constants,
  ORAC::TempFile, Starlink::Versions, LWP::Simple and IO::File.

Other classes can be loaded from within the recipe as needed.

The objects accessible to the recipe are:

=over 4

=item B<$CURRENT_PRIMITIVE>

Reference to an array containing a list of currently running
primitives.

=item B<$Frm>

The current frame object to be processed. This is of
class C<ORAC::Frame> (or subclass thereof).

=item B<$Grp>

The group object associated with the current frame to be
processed. This is of class C<ORAC::Group> (or subclass thereof).
The C<$BATCH> variable controls how many frames are visible
to the group object.

=item B<$Cal>

The calibration object to use for this frame. This is of
class C<ORAC::Calib> (or subclass thereof).

=item B<$Display>

The object associated with the ORAC Display system. This
is of class C<ORAC::Display>. The display system has not been
initialised if this variable has a value of undef. Primitives
should check to see that the variable is defined before
attempting to use it.

=back

The following global variables are also available to the recipe:

=over 4

=item B<%Mon>

Hash containing all the algorithm engine objects.

=item B<$DEBUG>

This flag can be used to turn on some debugging features.

=item B<$BATCH>

Flag to indicate whether the groups have been populated before
the recipe is executed (ie whether the pipeline is running in
batch mode or not).

=back

The namespace in which the recipe is executed is not specified
and may change at any time.

=item B<_read_recipe>

Read the recipe from disk and pass to the parser.

  $rec->_read_recipe();

The instrument, frame object and recipe name must be set in the object for optimal
parsing. The frame object can be left out in some cases (eg if a parse test
is being performed). An error will occur during execution if the frame object is required.

The search path is set from the instrument name and from the
C<ORAC_RECIPE_DIR> environment variable. The C<ORAC_RECIPE_DIR>
environment variable is similar to a normal C<PATH> variable in that
multiple directories can be supplied if separated by colons.

Croaks if the recipe could not be found or opened. Returns ORAC__OK
on success.

package ORAC::Recipe::Execution;

=head1 NAME

ORAC::Recipe::Execution - Namespace used for ORAC-DR recipe execution

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This namespace exists purely for executing ORAC-DR recipes. It provides
run time recipe processing routines and any additional classes that
are provided for recipe execution. It exists to separate recipe
execution from recipe naming.

=cut

use strict;
use warnings;
use ORAC::Print;
use ORAC::LogFile;
use ORAC::General;
use ORAC::Constants qw/ :status /;
use ORAC::TempFile;

  orac_warn("Features of the pipeline requiring HTTP access will not be available\n");
};


use Starlink::Versions qw/ :Funcs /;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

These recipe runtime functions are provided:

=over 4

=item B<orac_execute_recipe>

Simple wrapper to eval in this namespace in order to execute recipes
without fear of possible contamination of the base recipe namespace.

  $status = orac_execute_recipe( $CURRENT_PRIMITIVE, $Recipe, $Frm, $Grp, 
                                 $Cal, $Display, $Mon);

The recipe is a C<ORAC::Recipe> object. The basic objects have to
be supplied since they can not be set inside the recipe prior to
execution (the stringified objects have no meaning). The debug and
batch variables are passed in as recipe globals.

Note that $DEBUG in recipes and primitives is set during compile time and
not during execution.

    return $coderef->( 0, $Frm, $Grp, $Cal, $Display, $Mon );
  } else {
    return ORAC__ERROR;
  }
}

=item B<current_primitive>

Class method to set the current primitive during execution.

  ORAC::Recipe::Execution->current_primitive( $primitive_name, $depth );

The depth is reported in case only top level updates are required.

=cut
