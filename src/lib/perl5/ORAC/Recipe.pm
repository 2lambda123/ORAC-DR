=head1 METHODS

The following methods are available:

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

The constructor instantiates a new object and, if the recipe name and
instrument are given, reads the recipe from disk.

  $r = new ORAC::Recipe;
  $r = new ORAC::Recipe( NAME => $name,
                         INSTRUMENT => $instrument );

The instrument name is required in order to configure the recipe
search path.

=head2 Accessor Methods

=over 4

=item B<batch>

Set or return the batch processing status. If batch is set to true 
the recipe will process groups that have been pre-populated with
unprocessed frames..

  $batch = $rec->batch;

=cut

sub batch {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{BATCH} = shift };
  return $self->{BATCH};
}


=item B<debug>

Set or return the debug status. If debug is set to true 
the processed recipe will include additional debug statements.

  $rec->debug(1);

=cut

sub debug {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{DEBUG} = shift };
  return $self->{DEBUG};
}


=item B<instrument>

Set or return the instrument name. This is required to configure
search paths to determine recipe and primitive location.

  $inst = $rec->instrument;

=cut

sub instrument {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{Instrument} = shift };
  return $self->{Instrument};
}

=item B<recipe_name>

Return (or set) the name of the recipe to be processed.

  $name = $rec->recipe_name;
  $rec->recipe_name("REDUCE_DARK");

=cut

sub recipe_name {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{RecipeName} = shift };

# Internal access to parsed recipe
# Returns the array reference.
# With arguments:
#   - If the argument is an array reference the reference
#     is copied in
#   - if the first argument is not a reference the entire @_
#     is copied into the array overwriting any previous contents.

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<check_syntax>

Executes the recipe to check syntax. The method modifies the
recipe by setting dummy input variables and causing the recipe
to exit immediately after perl parses the recipe.

The return status is identical to that from C<execute> method
in that the process may die after syntax checking. If this
is not required an eval block should be used.

  $rec->check_syntax;

The recipe stored in the object is not modified so that
in principal the recipe could be executed after the recipe
check.

=cut

sub check_syntax {
  my $self = shift;

  # Dummy variables
  my ($Frm,$Grp,$Cal,$Display,%Mon);
  my $CURRENT_PRIMITIVE;
  my $PRIMITIVE_LIST = [];

  try {
    $self->execute( \$CURRENT_PRIMITIVE, \$PRIMITIVE_LIST, 
                    $Frm, $Grp, $Cal, $Display, \%Mon, {SYNTAX => 1});
  }
  catch ORAC::Error::FatalError with
  {
     my $Error = shift;
     $Error->throw;
  }
  otherwise
  {
     my $Error = shift;
     throw ORAC::Error::FatalError("$Error", ORAC__FATAL);
  };
}


=item B<execute>

Executes the recipes stored in the object.
Also needs the current frame, group and calibration objects
as well as the hash containing all the messaging objects.

  $rec->execute( \$CURRENT_PRIMITIVE, \$PRIMITIVE_LIST, 
                 $Frm, $Grp, $Cal, $Display, \%Mon);

The following classes are avaiable to primitive writers:

  ORAC::Print, ORAC::LogFile, ORAC::General, ORAC::Constants,
  ORAC::TempFile, Starlink::Versions, LWP::Simple and IO::File.

Other classes can be loaded from within the recipe as needed.

The objects accessible to the recipe are:

=over 4

=item B<$CURRENT_PRIMITIVE>

Reference to an array containing a list of currently running
primitives.

=item B<$Frm>

The current frame object to be processed. This is of
class C<ORAC::Frame> (or subclass thereof).

=item B<$Grp>

The group object associated with the current frame to be
processed. This is of class C<ORAC::Group> (or subclass thereof).
The C<$BATCH> variable controls how many frames are visible
to the group object.

=item B<$Cal>

The calibration object to use for this frame. This is of
class C<ORAC::Calib> (or subclass thereof).

=item B<$Display>

The object associated with the ORAC Display system. This
is of class C<ORAC::Display>. The display system has not been
initialised if this variable has a value of undef. Primitives
should check to see that the variable is defined before
attempting to use it.

=back

The following global variables are also available to the recipe:

=over 4

=item B<%Mon>

Hash containing all the algorithm engine objects.

=item B<$DEBUG>

This flag can be used to turn on some debugging features.

=item B<$BATCH>

Flag to indicate whether the groups have been populated before
the recipe is executed (ie whether the pipeline is running in
batch mode or not).

=back

The namespace in which the recipe is executed is not specified
and may change at any time.

=item B<parse>

Parses the recipe read via C<read_recipe>, reading in the
necessary primitives and adding additional error checking code.

Takes a reference to the tied array which defines the recipe
window listbox contents as an optional argument.

  $rec->parse( $PRIMITIVE_LIST );

Once parsed the recipe is ready for execution.

Returns ORAC__OK on completion.

=item B<read_recipe>

Read the recipe from disk. The recipe must then be parsed
to insert the primitive code.

  $rec->read_recipe( NAME => "REDUCE_DARK",
                     INSTRUMENT => "IRCAM" );

The arguments are optional if the C<instrument> or C<recipe_name>
methods have been set previously and override previous values.

The search path is set from the instrument name and from the
C<ORAC_RECIPE_DIR> environment variable. The C<ORAC_RECIPE_DIR>
environment variable is similar to a normal C<PATH> variable in that
multiple directories can be supplied if separated by colons.

Croaks if the recipe could not be found or opened. Returns ORAC__OK
on success.

=item B<_parse_recursively>

Parses and reads a recipe from disk translating primitive
directives to native code.

This routine uses recursion to parse the recipe until no more
primitive include directives are present. A recursion depth
of 10 is imposed to deal with out-of-control recipe recursion
(usually where a primitive calls itself). This should not be a
problem for working primitives.

The depth parameter is an integer specifying the current recursion
depth. When called externally, the depth should be set to 0 or C<undef>.
It is inremented internally during recursion.

   $processed_chunk = $rec->_parse_recursively( \@chunk, $name,
                                                \@PRIMTIIVE_LIST,
					        [ $depth ]);

When called externally the array to be processed is usually the
raw recipe. The return value is a reference to an array containing
the processed recipe chunk.

The second argument is the name of the current primitive/recipe that
is being parsed. This is used for providing line counts.  The third
argument is a reference to an array which is used to contain the
current primitive status as the recipe executes.

Line numbering is added automatically so that warnings and errors should
refer to the correct place in the actual primitive or recipe rather than
line numbers in a translated recipe. In order to provide some idea of the
position of the primitive within the recipe line numbers are incremented
by 1000 for each level of recursion. ie if the error is stated to be
at line 1164 this means that it is in line 164 of the primitive but that
the primitive was called by another primitive.

Reads the specified primitive from the recipe directory.
An array reference containing the primitive is returned.

The location of the recipe is determined first by looking in the
directory specified with C<ORAC_PRIMITIVE_DIR> and then the ORAC
repository directories specified from C<ORAC::Inst::Defn>.  The
C<ORAC_PRIMITIVE_DIR> environment variable is similar to a normal
C<PATH> variable in that multiple directories can be supplied if
separated by colons.

If the primitive can not  be found the program aborts.

=head1 NAME

ORAC::Recipe::Execution - Namespace used for ORAC-DR recipe execution

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This namespace exists purely for executing ORAC-DR recipes. It provides
run time recipe processing routines and any additional classes that
are provided for recipe execution. It exists to separate recipe
execution from recipe naming.

=item B<orac_execute_recipe>

Simple wrapper to eval in this namespace in order to execute recipes
without fear of possible contamination of the base recipe namespace.

  $status = orac_execute_recipe( $CURRENT_PRIMITIVE, $recipe, $Frm, $Grp, 
                                 $Cal, $Display, $Mon, $DEBUG, $BATCH);

The recipe is a string to be evaluated. The basic objects have to
be supplied since they can not be set inside the recipe prior to
execution (the stringified objects have no meaning). The debug and
batch variables are passed in as recipe globals.
