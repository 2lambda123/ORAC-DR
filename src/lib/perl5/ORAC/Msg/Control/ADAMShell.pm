=head1 NAME

ADAMShell - Stub interface for control of ADAM Shell processes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Msg::Control::Shell;

  $ctrl = new ORAC::Msg::Control::Shell;
  $ctrl->timeout(600);

This is currently a stub interface that does nothing except
provide empty methods. This is provided so that invocation
of ADAM tasks via a system() interface can match the standard
ORAC-DR messaging environment.
