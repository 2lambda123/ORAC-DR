=head1 NAME

ORAC::Msg::EngineLaunch - Launch engines on demand

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Msg::EngineLaunch;

  $eng = new ORAC::Msg::EngineLaunch;

  $obj = $eng->engine("polpack_mon");
  $eng->detach("polpack_mon");
  (@ok, @nok) = $eng->contact_all;

  tie %Mon, "ORAC::Msg::EngineLaunch";
  $obj = $Mon{"polpack_mon"};
  delete $Mon{"polpack_mon"};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a means of launching arbritrary algorithm
engines on demand. If an engine has not previously been
launched the class will start it, if it has been launched it
will retrieve the current object. The algorithm engines will
be C<ORAC::Msg> task objects (eg L<ORAC::Msg::ADAM::Task>).
This allows engines to be launched only when required to minimize
resource demand.

It is also possible to tie the class to a hash. This allows
for a non-object oriented approach where the engine can be launched
simply by accessing the engine through the hash.

# Additionally, all engine launching should use this
# interface (not just recipe engines) and once more than
# one messaging interface is required this class should be
# modified to start the messaging interface on demand as
# well.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are provided:

=head2 Constructor

Object constructors.

=over 4

=item B<new>

Instantiate a new object ready for launching.

  $launch = new ORAC::Msg::EngineLaunch( $unique );

Since, in general, it is convenient for all parts of the code
to have access to previously launched engines, the default
behaviour is for the constructor to return the same object reference
each time it is called. If it is required for a completely new object
to be created each time the argument must be set to true.

ORAC-DR usually requires that access is provided to all previously
launched engines for efficiency (and to prevent name clashes).

=cut

sub new {

  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  # Read uniqueness argument
  my $unq = shift;

  my $obj;

  # If uniqueness flag is true we need a brand new object
  # We also need a new object is one has not been stored previously
  if ($unq || !defined $THIS) {

    $obj = {
	    Engines => {},
	    EngineID => {},
	    MessysLaunch => new ORAC::Msg::MessysLaunch(),
	   };

    # bless into the correct class
    bless( $obj, $class);

    # If we are not unique, store the object
    $THIS = $obj unless $unq;

  } else {
    # We need to retrieve $THIS from the package variable
    $obj = $THIS;
  }

  return $obj;
}

=head2 Accessor Methods


=over 4

=item B<engine>

Retrieve the object associated with the specified engine, launching
it if required.

  $obj = $launch->engine("polpack_mon");

C<undef> is returned if the engine could not be launched.

The engine object can be stored if two arguments are used.
A rudimentary check is made to make sure that the object
is a reference and that the C<contactw> method is supported.
It is not possible to check a true ISA relationship. If the
object does not satisfy this condition it is not stored and
a warning is raised with "-w".

  $launch->engine("polpack_mon", $object);

Returns a hash reference containing all the currently launched engines
if called without arguments.

  $launched = $launch->engine;

=cut

sub engine {
  my $self = shift;

  if (@_) {
    my $name = shift;

    # If we have a second argument we are expecting
    # to store a value
    if (@_) {
      my $obj = shift;

      # Store it
      if (defined $obj && UNIVERSAL::can($obj, "contactw")) {
	$self->{Engines}->{$name} = $obj;
      } else {
	warnings::warnif "engine: Supplied object does not have a contactw method"
      }

    } elsif (exists $self->{Engines}->{$name}) {
      # No other argument and we have already launched it
      # before, return it
      return $self->{Engines}->{$name};

    } else {
      # Need to launch the engine
      # and store it in the object
      print "Launching engine $name...\n" if $DEBUG;
      my $obj = $self->launch( $name );

      # Return it
      return $obj;
    }
  } else {
    return $self->{Engines};
  }
}

=item B<engine_id>

The message system identifier. This is used by some message systems
(e.g. ADAM) to indicate a specific identifier that should be used
to name the engine in the message system. This allows, for example,
the pipeline to attach to an engine that has been launched
outside of the pipeline infrastructure. For engines launched
by the pipeline each new identifier must be unique for each pipeline
and for each repeat monolith launch (in the case where engines
die and are restarted).

This method is used to store the previous id for each engine so that
a new id can be generated.

  $id = $launch->engine_id( $engine );
  $launch->engine_id( $engine, $id );

The C<engine_inc> method should be used to generate a new id.

If no arguments are supplied a reference to the hash of IDs is
returned. C<undef> is returned if an id is requested for an
engine that has not been launched.

=cut

sub engine_id {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    my $eng = shift;
    if (@_) {
      my $id = shift;
      $self->{EngineID}->{$eng} = $id;
      return $id;
    } elsif (exists $self->{EngineID}->{$eng}) {
      return $self->{EngineID}->{$eng};
    } else {
      return undef;
    }
  }
  return $self->{EngineID};
}

=item B<messys_launch_object>

Returns the C<ORAC::Msg::MessysLaunch> object that can be used
to initialise message systems as required by the particular
algorithm engines.

 $messys = $self->messys_launch_object;

=cut

sub messys_launch_object {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->{MessysLaunch};
}

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<contact_all>

Runs the C<contactw> method on each registered engine. Can be used
to make sure that all the registered engines are okay.
If an engine can not be contacted it is removed from the object.

Returns two arrays, one for engines that could be contacted and
one for engines that could not be contacted.

  ($okay, $notokay) = $launch->contact_all;

In a scalar context simply returns true if all engines could be
contacted. Also returns true if there are no registered engines.

  $all_okay = $launch->contact_all;

The message system timeout is reduced to 30 seconds whilst
waiting for contact. It is subsequently reset afterwards. This
allows the pipeline configuration of timeout to vary from that
required simply to check that the monolith can be contacted.

=cut

sub contact_all {
  my $self = shift;

  my (@okay, @notokay);

  # Loop over all engines
  my %engines = %{ $self->engine };

  # Loop over each engine
  for my $eng (keys %engines) {

    my $messys = $self->_get_engine_messys_object( $eng );
    my $timeout = $messys->timeout;
    $messys->timeout($WAIT);

    print "Waiting for engine $eng..."
      if $DEBUG;

    # Wait for contact and store in correct array
    if ($engines{$eng}->contactw) {
      push(@okay, $eng);
    } else {
      print " not " if $DEBUG;
      push(@notokay, $eng);
      $self->detach($eng);
    }
    print "okay\n" if $DEBUG;
    $messys->timeout($timeout);

  }

  if (wantarray) {
    return (\@okay, \@notokay);
  } else {
    if (@notokay) {
      return 0;
    } else {
      return 1;
    }
  }
}


=item B<detach>

Disassociate the named engine from the object. This can be used
if an engine has crashed and it is necessary to launch a new
engine next time.

  $launch->detach( $engine );

=cut

sub detach {
  my $self = shift;
  my $engine = shift;
  # engine IDs must remain intact so that they will be different
  # next time around
  delete $self->engine->{$engine};
}


=item B<launch>

Launch the specified monolith.

  $obj = $launch->launch( $engine );

The engine object is stored in the class.  Returns undef on error.

The routine does not return until the engine has completed loading
(i.e. the C<contactw> method returns successfully). This is less
efficient than launching all the monoliths and then waiting for
them but it is the price paid for launching on demand.

This overhead can be overcome by pre-launching engines that are
known to be required and launching optional engines on demand.
If multiple engine names are supplied to this method they will
all be launched at once without waiting for each one in turn.
A hash is returned containing all the objects that were launched.

  %obj = $launch->launch( $engine1, $engine2 );

If multiple engines are launched simultaneously, the status of the
engines must then be checked explicitly using the C<contact_all>
method.

If the engines are launched outside this infrastructure they can be
registered with the object using the C<engine> method for the object,
and C<engine_id> method to register the messaging name (if
appropriate).

If a request is made to launch an engine that has been launched
previously the request returns the current engine object. Use 
C<detach> to force a reload.

  my $self = shift;

=head1 TIED INTERFACE

This class also provides a means of tieing an object to
a standard perl hash allowing for transparent access to
engines.

A hash can be tied to an object by using the C<tie> function:

  tie %Mon, "ORAC::Msg::Engine::Launch";

It is also possible to tie a hash to an existing object:

  tie %Mon, ref($object), $object;

The following can be used to retrieve the object associated with
"polpack_mon" launching the engine if necessary:

  $object = $Mon{"polpack_mon"};

Engines can be dissassociated from the object using the
standard hash C<delete> command:

  delete $Mon{"polpack_mon"};

C<exists>, C<keys> and C<each> are supported.

Note that C<exists> will I<not> launch a monolith. It can only
be used to check that one has already been launched.

In addition, it is possible to explicitly set entries in the hash. A
rudimentary check is made to check that the stored entry is an object
that can invoke a "contactw" method but it is not possible to check
that the object is of the correct type (since there is currently no
complete inheritance tree for engines). If the argument is not okay
the object a warning will be issued under "-w".

  $Mon{engine} = $some_object;

A reference to the hash still has access to the tied hash.  A copy of
the hash (e.g. C<%New = %Old>) will copy the contents of the hash
without copying the tie.  In order to copy the hash and retain the
tie, it is necessary to tie the new hash rather than copying it.

  $object = tied %Mon;
  tie %New, ref($object), $object;
