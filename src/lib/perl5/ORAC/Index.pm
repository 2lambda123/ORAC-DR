=head1 NAME

ORAC::Index - perl routines for manipulating ORAC index files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use ORAC::Index;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides subs for manipulating ORAC index files. ORAC
index files consist of whitespace seperated columns containing
information about a particular frame.

In the case of calibration index files, these may also contain rules
for determining the suitability of use for these frames. These consist
of code that is TRUE or FALSE depending on appropriate header values
of the object to be calibrated.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of an B<ORAC::Index> object.

  $Index = new ORAC::Index;
  $Index = new ORAC::Index($indexfile, $rulesfile);

Any arguments are passed to the configure() method.

=cut

sub new {

  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

  my $index = {
	       IndexEntries => {},
	       IndexFile => undef,
	       IndexFileHandle => undef,
	       IndexRules => {},
	       IndexRulesFile => undef,
	       RulesOK => 0,
	      };

  bless($index, $class);

  if (@_) { $index->configure(@_)};

  return $index;
}

=head2 Accessor Methods

=over 4

=item B<configure>

Takes an index file and a rules file and sets up the index object

  $Index->configure($indexfile, $rulesfile);

=cut

sub configure {
  my $self = shift;
  my ($file,$rules) = @_;
  # make sure rules files are read before we read the contents
  $self->indexrulesfile($rules);
  $self->indexfile($file);
};


=item B<indexfile>

Return (or set) the filename of the index file

  $file = $Index->indexfile;
  $Index->indexfile($file);

=cut


sub indexfile {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    $self->{IndexFile} = shift;
    $self->slurpindex;
  };
  return $self->{IndexFile};
};

=item B<rulesok>

Returns true if we are using a valid set of rules, false
if the rules were automatically generated from a read of the
index file (and therefore contain no clauses for verification).

=cut

sub rulesok {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    $self->{RulesOK} = shift;
  }
  return $self->{RulesOK};
}


=item B<indexrulesfile>

Return (or set) the filename of the rules file

If the rules file has the magic value of ORAC::Index::NO_RULES a lightweight
version of the object will be instantiated that does not do any
explicit rules checking. This only works if an index file is being
read (since the rules column names will be read from the index file),
rather than being freshly created (there will be no columns in the
output file!).

=cut

sub indexrulesfile {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    my $rfile = shift;
    croak "Rules files supplied to indexrulesfile() must be defined\n"
      unless defined $rfile;
    if ($rfile ne NO_RULES) {
      $self->{IndexRulesFile} = $rfile;
      $self->slurprules;
      $self->rulesok(1);
    } else {
      $self->rulesok(0);
    }
  }
  return $self->{IndexRulesFile};
};


=item B<rulesref>

Returns or sets the reference to the hash containing the rules

=cut

sub rulesref {
  my $self = shift;

  if (@_) {
    my $arg = shift;
    croak("Argument is not a hash") unless ref($arg) eq "HASH";
    $self->{IndexRules} = $arg;
  }

  return $self->{IndexRules};
}

=item B<indexref>

Returns or sets the reference to the hash containing the index

=cut

sub indexref {
  my $self = shift;

  if (@_) { 
    my $arg = shift;
    croak("Argument is not a hash") unless ref($arg) eq "HASH";
    $self->{IndexEntries} = $arg;
  }

  return $self->{IndexEntries};
}

=item B<indexkeys>

Return all the keys associated with the index file (ie from C<indexref>
method. These can then be used in conjunction with C<indexentry> to obtain
the content of the index.

 @keys = $index->indexkeys;

=cut

sub indexkeys {
  my $self = shift;
  return keys %{ $self->indexref };
}

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item slurprules

Sets up the index rules in the object. Croaks if it fails.
This converts the index rules file into an internal hash
that can be retrieved with the rulesref() method.

=cut

sub slurprules {

  my $self = shift;
  my $file = $self->indexrulesfile;

  croak "Rules file name is undefined\n" unless defined $file;

    croak("Couldn't open rules file '".(defined $file ? $file : "<undef>" )."': $!");

  }

  $self->rulesref(\%rules);

}


=item B<slurpindex>

Sets up the index data in the object. Croaks if it fails.  This
converts the index file name into an internal hash that can be
retrieved using the indexref() method.  There is one optional
argument.  The supplied argument is used to control the behaviour of
the read. If the 'usekey' flag is true the first string in each row
(space separated) is used as a key for the index hash.

If 'usekey' is false the key for each row is created 
automatically. This is useful for indexes where the contents 
of the index is more important than any particular key.

  $index->slurpindex(0); # Auto-generate keys

Default behaviour (ie no args) is to read the key from the
index file (ie usekey=1).

=item B<append_to_index>

Method to force an append of the specified index entry to the
the index file on disk.

  $Index->append_to_index($name);

$name is the name of the key (indexentry) to use to select the
index entry to append [cf the indexentry() method].

This method is intended to be called from the add() method
to speed up index read/write when appending a new entry.
Do not use this method to write a modified entry to the
index file (since the original entry will still be on disk)

No return value.

=item B<index_to_text>

Convert an index entry (in the index hash) to text suitable for
writing to an index file. Called by writeindex() and append_to_index()

  $text = $Ind->index_to_text($entry);

Returns the text string (including the entry name but no carriage 
return).

ARRAY or HASH references are serialised (although the current output
format restricts the use of spaces).

}


=item B<indexentry>

Returns a hash containing the key value pairs of the
selected index entry.

Input argument is the index entry name (ie the key in the hash
that returns the information (in an array).

Returns a hash reference if successful, undef if error.

=item B<verify>

verifies a frame (in the form of a hash reference) against a 
(calibration) index entry (ie by supplying the hash key to the index
entry). An optional third argument is available to turn off warning 
messages -- default is for warning messages to be turned on (true)

  $result = $index->verify(indexkey, \%hash, $warn);

Returns undef (error), 0 (not suitable), or 1 (suitable)

=item B<choosebydt>

Chooses the optimal (nearest in time to an observation) calibration
frame from the index hash

  $calibration = $Index->choosebydt($key, \%header, $warn);

Key is the name of the field that should be compared (eg ORACTIME)
and %header is the hash containing the header values that are to
be compared with the index rules. $warn is an optional third argument
that can be used to turn off warning messages from verify (default
is to report messages - true).

This method returns the name of the calibration frame closest in 
time that has met the selection criteria.

If a suitable calibration can not be found an undefined value is returned.

=cut


sub choosebydt {
  my $self=shift;
  return  $self->choosebydt_generic('ABS', @_);
}

=item B<chooseby_positivedt>

Chooses the calibration frame closest in time from above by looking 
in the index file (ie difference between the index file entry and
the current frame is positive).

  $calibration = $Index->chooseby_positivedt($key, \%header, $warn);

Key is the name of the field that should be compared (eg ORACTIME)
and %header is the hash containing the header values that are to
be compared with the index rules. $warn is an optional third argument
that can be used to turn off warning messages from verify (default
is to report messages - true).

This method returns the name of the calibration frame closest in 
time that has met the selection criteria.

This is similar to the choosebydt() method except that only
calibrations taken after the current time (read from the
header) can be chosen. undef is returned if no suitable
calibration frames can be found (eg because we are running
on-line and they have not even been taken yet).


=cut

}

=item B<chooseby_negativedt>

Chooses the calibration frame closest in time from below by looking 
in the index file (ie delta time between the index entry and the 
current frame is negative).

  $calibration = $Index->chooseby_negativedt($key, \%header, $warn);

Key is the name of the field that should be compared (eg ORACTIME)
and %header is the hash containing the header values that are to
be compared with the index rules. $warn is an optional third argument
that can be used to turn off warning messages from verify (default
is to report messages - true).

This method returns the name of the calibration frame closest in 
time that has met the selection criteria.

This is similar to the choosebydt() method except that only
calibrations taken before the current time (read from the
header) can be chosen. undef is returned if no suitable 
calibration can be found.

}


=item B<choosebydt_generic>

Internal routine for handling calibraion matches using a 
time difference.

  $calibration = $Index->choosebydt_generic(TYPE, $key, \%header, $warn);

TYPES can be 'ABS' (chooses the closest calibration in time), 
'POSITIVE' (chooses the closest in time from calibrations earlier
than the current header) and 'NEGATIVE' (chooses calibrations after
the current observation [as described by %header]).

KEY, HEADER and WARN are described in the choosebydt() documentation.

=item B<cmp_with_hash>

Compares each index entry with the values in the supplied hash
(supplied as a hash reference). The key to the first matching 
index entry is returned. undef is returned if no match could be 
found.

  $key = $index->cmp_with_hash(\%hash);
  $key = $index->cmp_with_hash({ key1 => 'value',
                                 key2 => 'value2'});

Use the indexentry() method to convert this key into the actual
index entry. Note that warning messages are turned off during the
verification stage since we are not interested in failed matches.

Returns 'undef' if no match is found or if no argument is supplied
[or that argument itself is undef]

=cut

sub cmp_with_hash {

  my $self = shift;

  # Read the has
  my $hashref = shift;

  # Return undef if the hashref is undef
  return unless defined $hashref;

  # Croak if the argument is not a hash
  croak("cmp_with_hash: Argument is not a hash")
    unless ref($hashref) eq "HASH";

  # Get a copy of the index
  my %index = %{ $self->indexref };

  # Go through all the keys in the index comparing
  # the index entry with the supplied hash using the rules

  for my $entry (keys %index) {
    my $ok = $self->verify($entry, $hashref, 0);

    return $entry if ($ok);
  }

  # If we get this far we have no match
  return;
}

=item B<scanindex>

Scan the index file for entries that match the supplied constraints.
Only string equality constraints are supported. For more complex scans,
consider using the rules system directly.

  @entries = $index->scanindex( UNITS => 'ARCSEC', FILTER => '850W' );

The return entries are not sorted into any particular order.

Regular expression matching is supported by supplying a string
beginning and ending with forward slashes (e.g. '/^g/' will match a
string starting with 'g').

Matching against the index entry's ID (i.e. the first column in an
index) can be done by supplying the hash key ':ID'.

      push(@match, $entry);

    }

  return @match;
}

=item B<_sanity_check>

Make sure that the rules and index entry are consistent.

 $Idx->_sanity_check( \@calibdata );

Takes the entry data as argument (does not try to 
work out that information itself).

Will die if they are inconsistent.
