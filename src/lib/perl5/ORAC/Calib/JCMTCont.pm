=head1 NAME

ORAC::Calib::JCMTCont - JCMT Continuum Calibration

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Calib::JCMTCont;

  $Cal = new ORAC::Calib::JCMTCont;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains methods for specifying JCMT continuum-specific calibration
objects. It provides a class derived from ORAC::Calib::JCMT. All the methods
available to ORAC::Calib::JCMT objects are also available to
ORAC::Calib::JCMTCont objects.

It is expected that this module will be subclassed with instrument specific
variations.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are available:

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Sub-classed constructor. Adds knowledge of optical depth and other
JCMT continuum-specific calibration information.

=cut

sub new {
  my $self = shift;
  my $obj = $self->SUPER::new( @_ );

# This assumes we have a hash object.
  $obj->{EngineLaunch} = new ORAC::Msg::EngineLaunch;

  $obj->{CsoFit} = undef;      # Polynomial tau fits

  return $obj;
}

=head2 Accessors

=over 4

=item B<default_fcfs>

Return the defaults FCF lookup table indexed by filter

 %FCFS = $cal->default_fcfs();

=cut

sub default_fcfs {
  croak "Must subclass default_fcfs()";
}

=item B<secondary_calibrator_fluxes>

Return the lookup table of fluxes for secondary calibrators.

 %photfluxes = $cal->secondary_calibrator_fluxes();

=cut

sub secondary_calibrator_fluxes {
  croak "Must subclass secondary_calibrator_fluxes()";
}

=item B<engine_launch_object>

Returns the C<ORAC::Msg::EngineLaunch> object that can be used
to initialise message systems as required by the particular
algorithm engines.

 $engobj = $self->engine_launch_object;

=cut

sub engine_launch_object {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->{EngineLaunch};
}


=item B<fluxes_mon>

Retrieves the algorithm engine object associated with
the Starlink fluxes monolith.

A new object is created if the value is undefined.

Relies on the Adam messaging system being available.
ADAM messaging will be initialised if not present.

=cut

sub fluxes_mon {
  my $self = shift;
  my $status;

  my $obj = $self->engine_launch_object->engine('fluxes');

  if (defined $obj) {
    return $obj;
  } else {
    croak 'Error launching fluxes monolith. Aborting.';
  }

}


=item B<gains>

Determines whether gains are derived from the default values
(DEFAULT) or from the index files (INDEX). Default is to
use the default gains. The value is upper-cased.

=cut

sub gains {
  my $self = shift;
  # Use the automatically created method
  my $g = $self->gainscache(@_);
  return (defined $g ? $g : "DEFAULT" );
}

=item B<skydipindex>

Return (or set) the index object associated with the skydip
index file. This index file is used if tausys() is set to skydip.

=cut

sub skydipindex {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->GenericIndex( "skydip", "dynamic", @_);
}

=item B<tausys>

Set (or retrieve) the name of the system to be used for
tau determination. Allowed values are 'CSO', 'SKYDIP',
'850SKYDIP' or a number. Currently the number is assumed to be the
CSO tau since this number is independent of wavelength.
'INDEX' is an allowed synonym for 'SKYDIP'. '850SKYDIP'
mode uses the results of 850 micron skydips from index
files to derive the opacity for the requested wavelength.

Additionally, modes 'DIPINTERP' and '850DIPINTERP' can be
used to interpolate the current tau from skydips taken
either side of the current observation.

Currently there is no way to specify an actual 850 micron
tau value (the number is treated as a CSO value). In the future
this may change (or a tausys of 850=value will be used??)

If tausys has not been set it defaults to 'CSO'. Default
can be over-ridden in subclass.

=cut

sub tausys {
  my $self = shift;
  # Use the automatically created method
  my $t = $self->tausyscache(@_);
  return (defined $t ? $t : "CSO" );
}

=item B<taucache>

Internal cache providing access to previously calculated tau values.
This is a reference to a hash of hashes with keys of uppercased
C<tausys()>, ORACTIME and filter name.

 $cacheref = $Cal->taucache;

 $tau = $Cal->taucache->{TAUSYS}->{'19980515.453'}->{$filter};

Returns a hash reference.

=cut

sub taucache {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->{TauCache};
}

=item B<csofit>

Object containing all the tau fitting information.
The object is configured the first time the information
is requested. The fitting data are located in
C<ORAC_DATA_CAL/csofit.dat>

=cut

sub csofit {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{CsoFit} = shift; }

=head2 General methods

=over 4


=item B<fluxcal>

Return the flux of a calibrator source

  $flux = $Cal->fluxcal("sourcename", "filter", $ismap);

The optional third argument is used to specify whether a map
flux (ie total integrated flux) is required (true), or
simply a flux in beam (used for photometry). Default is to
return flux in beam. This should return the same answer if the
calibrator is a point source.

Currently, all secondary calibrators are assumed to be point like.

Returns undef if the flux could not be determined.

=item B<gain>

Method to return the current gain (aka 'flux conversion factor')
for the specified filter that is usable for the current frame.

C<undef> is returned if no gain can be determined.

  $gain = $Cal->gain($filter, $units);

The units must be either BEAM (for Jy/beam/V) or ARCSEC (for
Jy/arcsec**2/V). If no units are supplied the default is BEAM.

If gains() is set to DEFAULT then this method will simply return
the current canonical gain for this filter (first trying a specific
filter [eg C<450w>] then trying a generic filter name [eg C<450>]).
This value will not take into account observing mode (eg scan map
gain is lower than jiggle map gain).

If gains() is set to INDEX the index will be searched for a calibration
observation that matches the observation mode (ie Chop throw, sample
mode, observing mode agree).

The current index system refuses to continue if a calibration can
not be found. In future this may well be changed so that the
DEFAULT values are used if no calibration is available.

It may also be useful if the gains either side of current observation
are retrieved so that the gain can be interpolated (as for tau
calculation).

=item B<iscalsource>

Given the source name and filter, work out whether we have calibration
information on this source (ie we know the flux for this filter). If
information is availble return true (1) else return (0).

  $yesno = $Cal->iscalsource("source_name","filter");

If filter is not supplied, it is assumed we are simply asking
whether the source is a calibrator independent of whether we
actually have a calibration value for it....

    }

  }

  return $iscal;

}


=item B<tau>

Returns the tau associated with the supplied filter.

  $tau = $Cal->tau($filter);

This routine works as follows. First tausys() is queried to determine
the system to use to calculate the tau. If this is CSO, the current
frame is queried for the CSO tau value stored and the tau calculated
for FILTER. If tausys() returns a number it is assumed
to be the actual CSO tau to use. If it is set to Skydip (or index) then
the selected wavelength is updated in the frame header (Key=FILTER)
and the skydip index is queried for the skydip that matched the criterion
and is closest in time.

The tausys='850SKYDIP' mode uses the results of 850 micron skydips
from index files to derive the opacity for the requested wavelength.

Additionally, modes 'DIPINTERP' and '850DIPINTERP' can be used to
interpolate the current tau from skydips taken either side of the
current observation.

The skydip modes will default to using CSO if a suitable
skydip can not be found. Also, a warning is raised if a skydip
is found but was takan more than 3 hours before or after the
current observation.

undef is returned if an error occurred [eg the CSO is so high that the
tau can not be calculated using the linear relationship].

The value is cached for a given tausys and observation (ORACTIME is
used for uniqueness) to prevent delays in searching for a tau when the
observation has not changed. It is very unlikely that a tau calibration
will change during a data reduction of a single frame (and, in reality
it is required that if you use a particular tau for extinction correction
that you can retrieve the exact same tau that was used at a later date).
The tau value is not cached if it can not be determined.

efficiently (without having to do special-cased pattern matching for
850W and 850N. See the C<tau()> method for the different interpolation
methods for skydips.

Returns the tau (undefined if no match). The tau will be for the selected
filter and will not be scaled to a reference filter.
