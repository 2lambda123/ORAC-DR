package ORAC::Calib::SCUBA;

=head1 NAME

ORAC::Calib::SCUBA - SCUBA calibration object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Calib::SCUBA;

  $Cal = new ORAC::Calib::SCUBA;

  $gain = $Cal->gain($filter);
  $tau  = $Cal->tau($filter);
  @badbols = $Cal->badbols;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module returns (and can be used to set) calibration information
for SCUBA. SCUBA calibrations are used for extinction correction
(the sky opacity) and conversion of volts to Janskys.

It can also be used to set and retrieve lists of bad bolometers generated
by noise observations.

This class does inherit from B<ORAC::Calib> although nearly all the
methods in the base class are irrelevant to SCUBA (this class only
uses the thing() method).

# Setup the object structure

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class.
These are in addition to the methods inherited from B<ORAC::Calib>.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a ORAC::Calib::SCUBA object.
The object identifier is returned.

  $Cal = new ORAC::Calib::SCUBA;

=cut

# NEW - create new instance of Calib

sub new {
  my $self = shift;
  my $obj = $self->SUPER::new( @_ );
  # Specify default tausys
  $obj->tausys( "850SKYDIP" );

  return $obj;
}

=back

=head2 Accessor Methods

=over 4

=item B<default_fcfs>

Return the default FCF lookup table indexed by filte.

 %FCFS = $cal->default_fcfs();

=cut

sub default_fcfs {
  return %FCFS;
}

=item B<secondary_calibrator_fluxes>

Return the lookup table of fluxes for secondary calibrators.

 %photfluxes = $cal->secondary_calibrator_fluxes();

=cut

sub secondary_calibrator_fluxes {
  return %PHOTFLUXES;
}

=item B<badbols>

Set or retrieve the name of the system to be used for bad bolometer
determination. Allowed values are:

=over 8

=item * index

Use an index file generated by noise observations
using the reflector blade. The bolometers stored in this
file are those that were above the noise threshold in
the _REDUCE_NOISE_ primitive. The index file is generated
by the _REDUCE_NOISE_ primitive

=item * file

Uses the contents of the file F<badbol.lis> (contains a space
separated list of bolometer names in the first line). This
file is in ORAC_DATA_OUT. If the file is not found, no
bolometers will be flagged.

=item * 'list'

A colon-separated list of bolometer names can be supplied.
If badbols=h7:i12:g4,... then this list will be used
as the bad bolometers throughout the reduction.

=back

Default is to use the 'file' method.
The value is always upper-cased.

=cut

sub badbols {
  my $self = shift;
  # Use the automatically created method
  my $bb = $self->badbolscache(@_);
  return (defined $bb ? $bb : "FILE" );
}

=back

=head2 General methods

=over 4

=item B<badbol_list>

Returns list of bolometer names that should be turned off for the
current observation. The source of this list depends on the setting
of the badbols() parameter (controlled by the user).
Can be one of 'index', 'file' or actual bolometer list. See the
badbols() method documentation for more information.

=cut

sub badbol_list {
  my $self = shift;

  # Retrieve the badbols query system
  my $sys = $self->badbols;

  # Array to store the bad bolometers
  my @badbols = ();

      } else {

	my $list = <$fh>;
	# close the file
	close $fh;
	# Split on spaces
	@badbols = split(/\s+/,$list);
      }

    }

  } else {
    # Look for bolometers in $sys itself
    # Split on colons - for now do not check whether the names
    # are sensible. If we were to do that we should do the check
    # outside this 'if' and before we return the list
    # Currently this check is done in the primitive at the same time
    # as the bolometer list is compared to the valid bolometers
    # stored in the Frame itself

    @badbols = split(/:/,$sys);

  # Return the list
