=head1 NAME

ORAC::Calib::SCUBA - SCUBA calibration object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Calib::SCUBA;

  $Cal = new ORAC::Calib::SCUBA;

  $gain = $Cal->gain($filter);
  $tau  = $Cal->tau($filter);
  @badbols = $Cal->badbols;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module returns (and can be used to set) calibration information
for SCUBA. SCUBA calibrations are used for extinction correction
(the sky opacity) and conversion of volts to Janskys.

It can also be used to set and retrieve lists of bad bolometers generated
by noise observations.

This class does inherit from B<ORAC::Calib> although nearly all the
methods in the base class are irrelevant to SCUBA (this class only
uses the thing() method).

=head2 Accessor Methods

=over 4

=item B<badbols>

Set or retrieve the name of the system to be used for bad bolometer
determination. Allowed values are:

=over 8

=item * index

Use an index file generated by noise observations
using the reflector blade. The bolometers stored in this
file are those that were above the noise threshold in 
the _REDUCE_NOISE_ primitive. The index file is generated
by the _REDUCE_NOISE_ primitive

=item * file

Uses the contents of the file F<badbol.lis> (contains a space
separated list of bolometer names in the first line). This
file is in ORAC_DATA_OUT. If the file is not found, no
bolometers will be flagged.

=item * 'list'

A colon-separated list of bolometer names can be supplied.
If badbols=h7:i12:g4,... then this list will be used
as the bad bolometers throughout the reduction.

=back

Default is to use the 'file' method.
The value is always upper-cased.

=cut

sub badbols {
  my $self = shift;

  $self->{BadBols} = 'FILE' unless (defined $self->{BadBols});
  return $self->{BadBols};
}

=item B<badbolsindex>

Return (or set) the index object associated with the bad bolometers
index file. This index file is used if badbols() is set to index.

=cut

sub badbolsindex {

  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{BadBolsIndex} = shift; }

    $self->{BadBolsIndex} = new ORAC::Index($indexfile,$rulesfile);
  };

  return $self->{BadBolsIndex};
}


=item B<badbolsnoupdate>

Flag to prevent the badbols system from being modified during data
processing.

=cut

sub badbolsnoupdate {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{BadBolsNoUpdate} = shift };
  return $self->{BadBolsNoUpdate};
}

=item B<engine_launch_object>

Returns the C<ORAC::Msg::EngineLaunch> object that can be used
to initialise message systems as required by the particular
algorithm engines.

 $engobj = $self->engine_launch_object;

=cut

sub engine_launch_object {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->{EngineLaunch};
}


=item B<fluxes_mon>

Retrieves the algorithm engine object associated with
the Starlink fluxes monolith.

A new object is created if the value is undefined.

Relies on the Adam messaging system being available.
ADAM messaging will be initialised if not present.

=cut

sub fluxes_mon {
  my $self = shift;
  my $status;

  my $obj = $self->engine_launch_object->engine('fluxes');

  if (defined $obj) {
    return $obj;
  } else {
    croak 'Error launching fluxes monolith. Aborting.';
  }

}


=item B<gains>

Determines whether gains are derived from the default values
(DEFAULT) or from the index files (INDEX). Default is to
use the default gains. The value is upper-cased.

=cut

sub gains {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{Gains} = uc(shift) unless $self->gainsnoupdate; }
  $self->{Gains} = 'DEFAULT' unless (defined $self->{Gains});
  return $self->{Gains};
}

=item B<gainsindex>

Return (or set) the index object associated with the gains
index file. This index file is used if gains() is set to INDEX.

=cut

sub gainsindex {

  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{GainsIndex} = shift; }

  unless (defined $self->{GainsIndex}) {
    my $indexfile = File::Spec->catfile($ENV{'ORAC_DATA_OUT'}, "index.gains");
    my $rulesfile = $self->find_file("rules.gains");
    $self->{GainsIndex} = new ORAC::Index($indexfile,$rulesfile);
  };

  return $self->{GainsIndex};
}

=item B<gainsnoupdate>

Flag to prevent the gains selection from being modified during data
processing.

=cut

sub gainsnoupdate {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{GainsNoUpdate} = shift };
  return $self->{GainsNoUpdate};
}


=item B<skydipindex>

Return (or set) the index object associated with the skydip
index file. This index file is used if tausys() is set to skydip.

=cut

sub skydipindex {

  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{SkydipIndex} = shift; }

  unless (defined $self->{SkydipIndex}) {
    my $indexfile = File::Spec->catfile($ENV{'ORAC_DATA_OUT'}, "index.skydip");
    my $rulesfile = $self->find_file("rules.skydip");
    $self->{SkydipIndex} = new ORAC::Index($indexfile,$rulesfile);
  };

  return $self->{SkydipIndex};
}


=item B<tausys>

Set (or retrieve) the name of the system to be used for
tau determination. Allowed values are 'CSO', 'SKYDIP',
'850SKYDIP' or a number. Currently the number is assumed to be the 
CSO tau since this number is independent of wavelength.
'INDEX' is an allowed synonym for 'SKYDIP'. '850SKYDIP'
mode uses the results of 850 micron skydips from index
files to derive the opacity for the requested wavelength.

Additionally, modes 'DIPINTERP' and '850DIPINTERP' can be 
used to interpolate the current tau from skydips taken
either side of the current observation.

Currently there is no way to specify an actual 850 micron
tau value (the number is treated as a CSO value). In the future
this may change (or a tausys of 850=value will be used??)

If tausys has not been set it defaults to '850SKYDIP'

=cut

sub tausys {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { $self->{TauSys} = uc(shift) unless $self->tausysnoupdate; }
  $self->{TauSys} = '850SKYDIP' unless (defined $self->{TauSys});
  return $self->{TauSys};
}

=item B<tausysnoupdate>

Flag to prevent the tau system from being modified during data

=item B<fluxcal>

Return the flux of a calibrator source

  $flux = $Cal->fluxcal("sourcename", "filter", $ismap);

The optional third argument is used to specify whether a map
flux (ie total integrated flux) is required (true), or 
simply a flux in beam (used for photometry). Default is to
return flux in beam. This should return the same answer if the
calibrator is a point source.

Currently, all secondary calibrators are assumed to be point like.

Returns undef if the flux could not be determined.

=item B<gain>

Method to return the current gain (aka 'flux conversion factor') 
for the specified filter that is usable for the current frame.

C<undef> is returned if no gain can be determined.

  $gain = $Cal->gain($filter, $units);

The units must be either BEAM (for Jy/beam/V) or ARCSEC (for
Jy/arcsec**2/V). If no units are supplied the default is BEAM.

If gains() is set to DEFAULT then this method will simply return
the current canonical gain for this filter (first trying a specific
filter [eg C<450w>] then trying a generic filter name [eg C<450>]).
This value will not take into account observing mode (eg scan map
gain is lower than jiggle map gain).

If gains() is set to INDEX the index will be searched for a calibration
observation that matches the observation mode (ie Chop throw, sample
mode, observing mode agree). 

The current index system refuses to continue if a calibration can
not be found. In future this may well be changed so that the
DEFAULT values are used if no calibration is available.

It may also be useful if the gains either side of current observation
are retrieved so that the gain can be interpolated (as for tau
calculation).

information is availble return true (1) else return (0).

whether the source is a calibrator independent of whether we
actually have a calibration value for it....

}


=item B<tau>

Returns the tau associated with the supplied filter.

  $tau = $Cal->tau($filter);

This routine works as follows. First tausys() is queried to determine
the system to use to calculate the tau. If this is CSO, the current
frame is queried for the CSO tau value stored and the tau calculated
for FILTER. If tausys() returns a number it is assumed
to be the actual CSO tau to use. If it is set to Skydip (or index) then
the selected wavelength is updated in the frame header (Key=FILTER)
and the skydip index is queried for the skydip that matched the criterion
and is closest in time.

The tausys='850SKYDIP' mode uses the results of 850 micron skydips
from index files to derive the opacity for the requested wavelength.

Additionally, modes 'DIPINTERP' and '850DIPINTERP' can be used to
interpolate the current tau from skydips taken either side of the
current observation.

The skydip modes will default to using CSO if a suitable
skydip can not be found. Also, a warning is raised if a skydip
is found but was takan more than 3 hours before or after the
current observation.

undef is returned if an error occurred [eg the CSO is so high that the
tau can not be calculated using the linear relationship].

The value is cached for a given tausys and observation (ORACTIME is
used for uniqueness) to prevent delays in searching for a tau when the
observation has not changed. It is very unlikely that a tau calibration
will change during a data reduction of a single frame (and, in reality
it is required that if you use a particular tau for extinction correction
that you can retrieve the exact same tau that was used at a later date).
The tau value is not cached if it can not be determined.

=item B<_get_default_fcf>

Given a filter, FCF units (BEAM or ARCSEC) and the UT date (in ORACUT
format) returns the default FCF values as derived from an automated
reduction of the complete data archive.

  $fcf = $self->_get_default_fcf( $filter, 'ARCSEC', '19980215');

Returns undef if no FCF is available for the specified combination.
