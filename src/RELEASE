Making a Starlink release
-------------------------

The following steps are required to make a starlink release of ORAC-DR:

- Update the starlink/oracdr.news file and commit it to SVN.

- Create a branch in SVN.

- Check out the branch.

- Record the version number and the branch name in a .version file located in
  the top-level ORAC-DR directory.

- Delete the src/.cvsignore file.

- Move the src/ directory to the top-level ORAC-DR directory.

- Remove any instruments from recipes/, primitives/, and cal/ that are not
  ready for release

- Move the oracdr.news file to the top-level ORAC-DR directory.

- Create documents:

  sun230: Set the ORAC_DIR environment variable to the top-level
  ORAC-DR directory. Set the ORAC_INSTRUMENT environment variable to
  UFTI2. Run the sun230.pl script, then 'star2html sun230.tex'.

  sun233: Set the ORAC_PERL5LIB environment variable to lib/perl5. Run the
  mkinclude.csh script, then 'star2html sun233.tex'.

- Copy the .tex, .ps, and .eps files into $STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX/docs. Copy
  the .htx directories into $STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX/docs.

- Remove the oracdr/starlink, /docs, /t and /uml directories

- Run the oracdr/admin/nongeneric_imaging.csh (remembering to set
  ORAC_DIR). Remove the 'admin' directory.

- Copy everything into $STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK/oracdr.
