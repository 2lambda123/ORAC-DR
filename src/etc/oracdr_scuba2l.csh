#  Name:
#     oracdr_scuba2l

#  Purpose:
#     Initialise ORAC-DR environment for use with the long-wave
#     SCUBA-2 arrays

#  Language:
#     C-shell script

#  Invocation:
#     source ${ORAC_DIR}/etc/oracdr_scuba2l.csh

#  Description:
#     This script initialises the environment variables and command
#     aliases required to run the ORAC-DR pipeline with SCUBA-2 data.
#     An optional argument is the UT date. This is used to configure
#     the input and output data directories but assumes a JAC
#     style directory configuration.

#  ADAM Parameters:
#     UT = INTEGER (Given)
#        UT date of interest. This should be in YYYYMMDD format.
#        It is used to set the location of the input and output
#        data directories. Assumes that the data are located in
#        a directory structure similar to that used at UKIRT.
#        Also sets an appropriate alias for ORAC-DR itself.
#        If no value is specified, the current UT is used.
#     $ORAC_DATA_ROOT = Environment Variable (Given)
#        Root location of the data input and output directories.
#        If no value is set, "/jcmtdata" is assumed.
#     $ORAC_CAL_ROOT = Environment Variable (Given)
#        Root location of the calibration files. $ORAC_DATA_CAL
#        is derived from this variable by adding the appropriate
#        value of $ORAC_INSTRUMENT. In this case $ORAC_DATA_CAL
#        is set to $ORAC_CAL_ROOT/scuba2. If ORAC_CAL_ROOT is not
#        defined it defaults to "/jcmt_sw/oracdr_cal".


#  Examples:
#     oracdr_scuba2l
#        Will set the variables assuming the current UT date.
#     oracdr_scuba2l 20081101
#        Use UT date 20081101.

#  Notes:
#     - The environment variables $ORAC_RECIPE_DIR and $ORAC_PRIMITIVE_DIR
#       are UNSET by this routine if they have been set.
#     - The data directories are assumed to be in directories "raw"
#       (for input) and "reduced" (for output) from root
#       $ORAC_DATA_ROOT/scuba2/sx/UT
#     - $ORAC_DATA_OUT and $ORAC_DATA_IN will have to be
#       set manually if the JAC directory structure is not in use.
#     - aliases are set in the oracdr_start.csh script sourced by
#       this routine.
