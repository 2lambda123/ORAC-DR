# Name:
#    BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE_NCOLOUR_APHOT

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a multi-colour bright-point-source photometry observation
#    and performs aperture photometry.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces a "bright standard" photometry observation
#    observed through one or more filters. For each filter it takes an
#    imaging observation comprising
#    a series of jittered object frames and a dark frame with a
#    predetermined flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic
#    automatically.

#    This recipe performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
#    between object frames, and resampling.  See the "Notes" for details.

#    Photometry of the point source using a fixed 5-arcsecond aperture
#    is calculated for each jitter frame and the mosaic.  The results
#    appear in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt in the form of a Starlink
#    small text list.  The analysis of each star is appended to this file.

#    As the name implies, it is intended for bright point sources,
#    such as standard stars.

# Notes:
#    -  You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
#    the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
#    to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
#    give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.  The
#    mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time (that being the
#    exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
#    noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers
#    are updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing to
#    the mosaic.
#    -  The photometry tabulation includes the file name, source name,
#    time, filter, airmass, the catalogue magnitude and estimates of
#    the zero-point with and without the application of a mean
#    extinction.  There are headings at the top of each column.
#    -  The photometry uses the mode calculated from 3*median-2*mean
#    and Chauvenet's rejection criterion to estimate the sky level in an
#    annulus about the source.  The inner annulus diameter is 1.3 times 
#    that of the aperture (6.5 arcsec); the outer annulus is 2.5 times 
#    (12.5 arcsec) for UFTI, and twice the aperture (10 arcsec) for IRCAM
#    Michelle, and IRIS2.
#    The errors are internal, based on the sky noise.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The resultant mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_<filter>_mos,
#    where <m> is "gf" for UFTI, "gi" for IRCAM and IRIS2, and "gu" for
#    UFTI, and <filter> is the filter name.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" for UFTI and "rg" for IRCAM.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI, "i" for IRCAM, and "u" for UIST.
#    Before 2000 August
#    IRCAM frames had prefix "ro". IRIS2 data are in <date><obs_number>_ff,

#       minus one is used.  If neither is available, 5 is the default.
#       An error state arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer
#       than 3.  For observations prior to the availability of full

BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE_NCOLOUR_APHOT -- Reduces a multi-colour bright-point-source photometry observation and performs aperture photometry.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a "bright standard" photometry observation observed
through one or more filters. For each filter it takes an imaging
observation comprising a
series of jittered object frames and a dark frame with a predetermined
flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic automatically.

This recipe performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
between object frames, and resampling.  See the L<"NOTES"> for details.

Photometry of the point source using a fixed 5-arcsecond aperture
is calculated for each jitter frame and the mosaic.  The results
appear in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt> in the form of a Starlink
small text list.  The analysis of each star is appended to this file.

As the name implies, it is intended for bright point sources,
such as standard stars.

The photometry uses the mode calculated from 3*median-2*mean
