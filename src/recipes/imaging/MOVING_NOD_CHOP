# Name:
#    MOVING_NOD_CHOP

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a chopped and nodded observation of a moving target.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a chopped and nodded observation, currently
#    just for Michelle data.  It takes an imaging observation
#    comprising a multiple-of-four object frames to make automatically
#    a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic in the reference frame of a moving
#    target.

#    It performs a null debiassing, creation and propagation of data
#    variance, difference the integrations for each AB chop beam pair,
#    bad-pixel masking, difference adjacent nodded pairs, registers the
#    frames, and forms a mosaic.  See the "Notes" for further information.

#    Registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
#    target using ephemeris data stored in file target_ephem.dat.
#    See "Ephemeris-file Format" for details of this file's format.

# Notes:
#    -  A variance array is created for each beam, first using the read
#    noise, and once the bias is removed, Poisson noise is added.
#    -  A bias frame selected from the calibration system is removed from
#    each beam in CHOP read mode.  If no bias frame is available
#    in the CHOP mode, the recipe subtracts a null bias, so the errors
#    will be overestimated in the CHOP read mode; the data array will
#    be unaffected once the beams are differenced.  The ARRAY_TESTS
#    recipe files a suitable short-exposure dark as a bias in the
#    calibration system.
#    -  The integrations of the two beams are differenced, the first
#    subtracted from the second in each pair.
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixel, adjusted for the motion of the target, so
#    that the final mosaic registers the target, not the background stars.
#    -  The ephemeris file is specified by environment variable
#    ORAC_EPHEMERIS, defaulting to $ORAC_DATA_OUT/target_ephem.dat.
#    -  The resampling applies integer shifts of origin.   There is no
#    rotation to align the Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of object frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, 
#    which has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master
#    mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also
#    summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise
#    the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the differenced pairs
#    _dp suffix) frames.

# Ephemeris-file Format:
#    The current format of the ephemeris file is one line per object
#    comprising three space-separated fields in the following order:
#      - the objectname, which may contain embedded spaces; 
#      - the motion in the plane of the sky in arcsec/second for right
#      ascension then declination.
#
#    Note that the right ascension motion is the change in right ascension
#    multiplied by the cosine of the declination.  The format will change
#    to include UT and possibly date.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gm" for Michelle.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of object frames in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_mos<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The differenced pairs in <i><date>_<obs_number>_dp,
#    where <i> is "m" for Michelle. 

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the nod pattern.  If absent, the number
#       of offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS, minus one is used.  If
#       neither is available, 4 is used.  An error state arises if
#       the number of jittered frames is fewer than 4 and not a
#       multiple of 4.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [1]

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK,
#    KAPPA, and FIGARO.

MOVING_NOD_CHOP -- Reduces a chopped and nodded observation of a moving target.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a chopped and nodded observation, currently
just for Michelle data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
a multiple-of-four object frames to make automatically a calibrated,
untrimmed mosaic in the reference frame of a moving target.

It performs a null debiassing, creation and propagation of data
variance, difference the integrations for each AB chop beam pair,
bad-pixel masking, difference adjacent nodded pairs, registers the
frames, and forms a mosaic.  See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

Registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
target using ephemeris data stored in file target_ephem.dat.
See L<"EPHEMERIS-FILE FORMAT"> for details of this file's format.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

A variance array is created for each beam, first using the read
noise, and once the bias is removed, Poisson noise is added.

=item *

A bias frame selected from the calibration system is removed from each
beam in CHOP read mode.  If no bias frame is available in the CHOP
mode, the recipe subtracts a null bias, so the errors will be
overestimated in the CHOP read mode; the data array will be unaffected
once the beams are differenced.  The L<ARRAY_TESTS|ARRAY_TESTS> recipe
files a suitable short-exposure dark as a bias in the calibration
system.

=item *

The integrations of the two beams are differenced, the first
subtracted from the second in each pair.

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item *

The resampling applies integer shifts of origin.   There is no

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received

time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

For each cycle of object frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
