# Name:
#    REDUCE_DARK

# Purpose:
#    Averages and files observations as the current dark.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces dark-frame observations with infrared imaging
#    data.  Multiple darks of the same exposure time are averaged.  It
#    files the single or averaged dark in the dark index file.  Other
#    reduction steps comprise bad-pixel masking, optional creation of
#    data errors.

# Notes:
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The dark is called dark_<exposure_time>_<group_number>.  For
#    single frames the group_number is the same as the frame number.
#    The decimal point in the time is replaced by "p".
#    -  The dark is filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.dark.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [1]
#    ** Disabled for IRIS2 ** No bias available
#       SDR, 3/3/2006

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through the intermediate file
#    to the dark.

REDUCE_DARK -- Averages and files observations as the current dark.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces dark-frame observations with infrared imaging
data.  Multiple darks of the same exposure time are averaged.  It
files the single or averaged dark in the dark index file.  Other
reduction steps comprise bad-pixel masking, optional creation of
data errors.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item * 

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted.

=item *

Sub-arrays are supported.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The dark called dark_E<lt>exposure_timeE<gt>_E<lt>frame_numberE<gt>.
For single frames the group number is the same as the frame number.
The decimal point in the time is replaced by "p".

=item *

The dark is filed in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.dark>.
