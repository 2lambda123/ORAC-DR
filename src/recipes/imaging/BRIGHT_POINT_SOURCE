# Name:
#    BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a bright-point-source photometry observation.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces a "bright standard" photometry observation.
#    It takes an imaging observation comprising
#    a series of jittered object frames and a dark frame, and a
#    predetermined flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed
#    mosaic automatically.

#    This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
#    between object frames, and resampling.  See the "Notes" for details.

#    As the name implies, it is intended for bright point sources,
#    such as standard stars.

# Notes:
#    -  You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
#    the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
#    to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
#    give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.  The
#    mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time (that being the
#    exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
#    noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers
#    are updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing to
#    the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The resultant mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "i" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August
#    IRCAM frames had prefix "ro". IRIS2 data are in <date><obs_number>_ff,
#    where <date> is in the format "ddmmm".

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern.  If this is not 
#       set, the number of offsets, as given by FITS header NOFFSETS,
#       minus one is used.  If neither is available, 5 is the default.
#       An error state arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer
#       than 3.  For observations prior to the availability of full
#       ORAC, header NOFFSETS will be absent.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]

# Timing:
#    This is a fast recipe and will keep pace with observations.

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK,
#    KAPPA, and FIGARO.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Error propagation is controlled by the USEVAR parameter.

BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE -- Reduces a bright-point-source photometry observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "bright standard" photometry observation with
UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising a
series of jittered object frames and a dark frame, and a predetermined
flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic automatically.

This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
between object frames, and resampling.  See the L<"NOTES"> for details.

As the name implies, it is intended for bright point sources,
such as standard stars.
