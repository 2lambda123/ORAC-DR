# Name:
#    MAKE_BPM

# Purpose:
#    Creates and files a bad-pixel mask from a long-exposure dark.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces a long-exposure dark-frame observation
#    of infrared imaging data to create a bad-pixel mask.  It files the
#    mask in the mask index file.  Reduction comprises only thresholding
#    the pixel values about a clipped mean using a multiple of the
#    clipped standard deviation.

# Notes:
#    -  The dark must have a minimum exposure of 20 seconds.
#    -  Clipping is at 2,3,3 standard deviations.
#    -  Bad values are deemed to be those beyond the range of
#    the clipped mean +/- 5 standard deviations.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The bad-pixel mask is called bpm_<frame_number>.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask is filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.mask.

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is bpm_<frame_number>.
#    -  Error propagation is not used.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a long-exposure dark-frame observation
of infrared imaging data to create a bad-pixel mask.  It files the
mask in the mask index file.  Reduction comprises only thresholding
the pixel values about a clipped mean using a multiple of the
clipped standard deviation.

=item *

The bad-pixel mask called bpm_E<lt>frame_numberE<gt>.
