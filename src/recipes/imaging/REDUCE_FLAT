# Name:
#    REDUCE_FLAT

# Purpose:
#    Reduces an imaging flat field.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    Reduces a flat field in the conventional manner consisting of
#    bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction, and normalisation by the
#    mean of the image. Files the normalised flat field frame for
#    use by subsequent flat fielding operations.

# Notes:
#    - This recipe will reduce any image passed to it. Care must be taken
#      to ensure that a proper flat field image will be reduced.
#    - The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    - The flat field is normalised using a clipped mean, where
#      the clipping levels are 2, 3, and 3 sigmas. Effectively,
#      this value is the mode of the image. The entire image is
#      divided by this value to normalise it.
#    - Intermediate frames are deleted.

# Output Data:
#    - The flat is called flat_<frame_number>.
#    - The flat is filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat.

REDUCE_FLAT - Reduces an imaging Flat Field

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reduces a flat field in the conventional manner consisting of
bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction, and normalisation by the
mean of the image. Files the normalised flat field frame for
use by subsequent flat fielding operations.

This recipe will reduce any image passed to it. Care must be taken
to ensure that a proper flat field image will be reduced.

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.

=item *

The flat field is normalised using a clipped mean, where the
clipping levels are 2, 3, and 3 sigmas. Effectively, this value
is the mode of the image. The entire image is divided by this
value to normalise it.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted.

The flat is called flat_<frame_number>.

=item *

The flat is filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat.
