# Name:
#    REDUCE_FLAT

# Purpose:
#    Reduces an imaging flat-field.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This reduces a flat-field in the conventional manner consisting of
#    bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction, and normalisation by the
#    mean of the image.  It also files the normalised flat-field frame
#    for use by subsequent flat-fielding operations.

# Notes:
#    - This recipe will reduce any image passed to it.  Care must
#    be taken to ensure that a proper flat-field image will be reduced.
#    - The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    - The flat field is normalised using a clipped mean, where
#    the clipping levels are 2, 3, and 3 standard deviationss.  This
#    value is effectively the mode of the image.  The entire image is
#    divided by this value to normalise it.
#    - Intermediate frames are deleted.

# Output Data:
#    - The flat is called flat_<frame_number>.
#    - The flat is filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat.

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages KAPPA and
#    CCDPACK.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through the intermediate file
#    to the flat.
#    -  Variance information is not supported.

REDUCE_FLAT -- Reduces an imaging flat-field

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This reduces a flat-field in the conventional manner consisting of
bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction, and normalisation by the
mean of the image.  It also files the normalised flat-field frame
for use by subsequent flat-fielding operations.

This recipe will reduce any image passed to it.  Care must be taken to
ensure that a proper flat-field image will be reduced.

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.

=item *

The flat field is normalised using a clipped mean, where
the clipping levels are 2, 3, and 3 standard deviationss.  This
value is effectively the mode of the image.  The entire image is
divided by this value to normalise it.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted.

The flat is filed in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat>.
