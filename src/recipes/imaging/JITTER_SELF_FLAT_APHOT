# Name:
#    JITTER_SELF_FLAT_APHOT

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation using
#    object masking, and performs aperture photometry.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
#    with near-infrared imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation
#    comprising jittered object frames and a dark frame to make a
#    calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field creation and division, feature
#    detection and matching between object frames, and resampling.
#    See the "Notes" for further information.

#    Photometry of the point source using a fixed 5-arcsecond aperture
#    is calculated for each jitter frame and the mosaic.  The results
#    appear in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt in the form of a Starlink
#    small text list.  The analysis of each star is appended to this file.

#    This recipe works well for faint sources in moderately crowded fields.

# Notes: 
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    headers are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  For INGRID, the pre- and post-exposure images are subtracted.
#    A non-linearity correction is then applied.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is created iteratively.  First an approximate
#    flat-field is created by combining normalised object frames using
#    the median at each pixel.  This flat field is applied to the object
#    frames.  Sources within the flat-fielded frames are detected, and
#    masked in the dark-subtracted frames.  The first stage is repeated
#    but applied to the masked frames to create the final flat field.
#    -  For ISAAC, residual bias variations along the columns are
#    largely removed from each flat-fielded frame.  The recipe first
#    masks the sources, then collapses the frame along its rows to form
#    a profile, whose clipped mean is subtracted.  The resultant profile
#    reflects the bias variations.  The recipe subtracts this profile
#    from each column of the flat-fielded frame.
#    -  The field distortion of ISAAC is corrected using the mappings
#    documented on the ISAAC problems web page.
#    -  Registration is performed using common point sources in the
#    overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
#    objects, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master
#    mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also
#    summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise
#    the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  The photometry tabulation includes the file name, source name,
#    time, filter, airmass, the catalogue magnitude and estimates of
#    the zero-point with and without the application of a mean
#    extinction.  There are headings at the top of each column.
#    -  The photometry uses a multiply clipped (2,2,2.5,3 standard 
#    deviations) mean to estimate the sky mode in an annulus about the
#    source.  This is not unduly biased by the presence of the self-flat
#    artifact in the pixel histogram.  The inner annulus diameter is 1.3 
#    times that of the aperture (6.5 arcsec); the outer annulus is 2.5
#    times (12.5 arcsec) for UFTI and twice the aperture (10 arcsec) for
#    IRCAM and IRIS2.  The errors are internal, based on the sky noise.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM (before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively), "gi" also for IRIS2, "giasaac"
#    for ISAAC, and "gingrid" for INGRID.

#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI, "i" for IRCAM, and "isaac" for ISAAC.

#    <date><obs_number>_ff, where <date> is in the form "ddmmm".  
#    INGRID files are called r<obs_number>_ff.

JITTER_SELF_FLAT_APHOT -- Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation using object masking.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation with
UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
jittered object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated,
untrimmed mosaic automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flat-field creation and division, feature
detection and matching between object frames, and resampling.
See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

Photometry of the point source using a fixed 5-arcsecond aperture
is calculated for each jitter frame and the mosaic.  The results
appear in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt in the form of a Starlink
small text list.  The analysis of each star is appended to this file.

This recipe works well for faint sources in moderately crowded fields.
