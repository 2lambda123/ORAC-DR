# Name:
#    MEASURE_READNOISE

# Purpose:
#    Measures and files the readnoise for UIST from a set of dark
#    frames.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe measures the readnoise for a group of five
#    short-exposure UIST DARK frames and files that measurement with the
#    calibration system.  It also determines the readnoise variance. 
#    The readnoise result is compared with the nominal value; you are
#    notified whether or not the value is within acceptable limits.
#    The recipe appends a tabulation of the readnoise and its variance
#    in an engineering log file, $ORAC_DATA_OUT/uist_array_tests.log,
#    which it creates with headings if the log does not exist.

# Notes:
#    -  The first dark frame is used to "clean up" the array before statistics
#    are done on the remaining frames.
#    -  The recipe calculates the readnoise as follows.  It first derives
#    the population variance estimate (PVE) of the dark frames, calculated 
#    on a per-pixel basis.  It then finds the square root of the mean of this
#    PVE image.  If the images were taken before UT 2002 December 2, the
#    readnoise is calculated as the product of the square root of the mean of
#    the PVE, the number of reads minus one, the read interval, and the
#    the gain, divided by the number of multiple reads.  Otherwise, the
#    readnoise is formed by multiplying the gain by the square root of the
#    mean.
#    -  The readnoise is nominal if it falls between 38 and 45 e-/second.

# Output Data:
#    -  The engineering log $ORAC_DATA_OUT/uist_array_tests.log.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    DARK_FRAMES = INTEGER
#       The number of dark frames to combine.  The maximum allowed is 9. [5]

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages KAPPA and
#    CCDPACK.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  Error propagation is not used.

MEASURE_READNOISE -- Measures and files the readnoise for UIST from a set of dark frames.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe measures the readnoise for a group of five short-exposure
UIST DARK frames and files that measurement with the calibration
system.  It also determines the readnoise variance. The readnoise
result is compared with the nominal value; you are notified whether or
not the value is within acceptable limits. The recipe appends a
tabulation of the readnoise and its variance in an engineering log
file, $ORAC_DATA_OUT/uist_array_tests.log, which it creates with
headings if the log does not exist.

=item *

The first dark frame is used to "clean up" the array before statistics
are done on the remaining frames.

The recipe calculates the readnoise as follows.  It first derives
the population variance estimate (PVE) of the dark frames, calculated 
on a per-pixel basis.  It then finds the square root of the mean of this
PVE image.  If the images were taken before UT 2002 December 2, the
readnoise is calculated as the product of the square root of the mean of
the PVE, the number of reads minus one, the read interval, and the
the gain, divided by the number of multiple reads.  Otherwise, the
readnoise is formed by multiplying the gain by the square root of the
mean.

The readnoise is nominal if it falls between 38 and 45 e-/second.
