MEASURE_READNOISE - measure and file the readnoise for UIST.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used to measure the readnoise for a group of UIST
DARK frames and file that measurement with the calibration system.
If this recipe is run in a UKIRT environment it will create or
append to a log file located at /ukirt_sw/logs/uist_array_tests.log.

# We do not want to go through all of the _IMAGING_HELLO_ steps.
# Actually, we just want to avoid the step where the data are converted
# to ADU, which is done in _INSTRUMENT_HELLO_. But, since the other
# steps like _CREATE_WCS_ aren't needed for this, we'll just create
# a raw frame.
