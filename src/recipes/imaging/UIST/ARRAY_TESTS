=head1 NAME

ARRAY_TESTS - calculates the readout noise and dark current, and determines
bad pixel masks and a group bias for UIST.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe calculates the NDSTARE readout noise and dark current, and
determines bad pixel masks and a group bias for UIST. It does this by
analyzing a group of engineering frames taken with the sequence called
array_tests. The resulting readnoise, group bias, and bad pixel mask are
all filed to the calibration system.
