=head1 NAME

DARK_AND_BPM - measure dark current and create a new bad
pixel mask for UIST.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used to measure the dark current for UIST, using a long-
exposure DARK frame. It first finds and bad pixels in the DARK, then 
measures and reports the dark current. If this recipe is run at UKIRT,
the dark current is stored in an engineering log file.
