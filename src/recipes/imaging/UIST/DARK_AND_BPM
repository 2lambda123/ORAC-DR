# Name:
#    DARK_AND_BPM

# Purpose:
#    Measures dark current and creates a new bad-pixel mask for UIST.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe is used to measure the dark current for UIST, using a
#    long-exposure DARK frame.  It first finds and bad pixels in the
#    DARK, then measures and reports the dark current.   The recipe
#    appends to a tabulation of the dark current in an engineering log
#    file, $ORAC_DATA_OUT/uist_array_tests.log, which it creates with
#    headings if the log does not exist.
 
# Notes:
#    - The recipe applies thresholds to the dark frame and flags pixels
#    outside these limits as bad.  The thresholds are derived from
#    3-standard-deviation clipped statistics; pixels more than 5
#    standard deviations above the mean are flagged.
#    - The bad pixels detected are added into the current bad-pixel mask
#    and then this is filed with the calibration system as a new and
#    current bad-pixel mask.
#    - The new bad-pixel mask is applied to the original dark frame,
#    whose unclipped mean scaled by the gain and inverse exposure time
#    is the dark current in electrons per second.

# Output Data:
#    -  The engineering log $ORAC_DATA_OUT/uist_array_tests.log.

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  Error propagation is not used.

DARK_AND_BPM -- Measures dark current and creates a new bad-pixel mask for UIST.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used to measure the dark current for UIST, using a
long-exposure DARK frame.  It first finds and bad pixels in the
DARK, then measures and reports the dark current.   The recipe
appends to a tabulation of the dark current in an engineering log
file, $ORAC_DATA_OUT/uist_array_tests.log, which it creates with
headings if the log does not exist.

=item *

The recipe applies thresholds to the dark frame and flags pixels
outside these limits as bad.  The thresholds are derived from
3-standard-deviation clipped statistics; pixels more than 5
standard deviations above the mean are flagged.

=item *

The bad pixels detected are added into the current bad-pixel mask
and then this is filed with the calibration system as a new and
current bad-pixel mask.

=item *

The new bad-pixel mask is applied to the original dark frame,
whose unclipped mean scaled by the gain and inverse exposure time
is the dark current in electrons per second.
