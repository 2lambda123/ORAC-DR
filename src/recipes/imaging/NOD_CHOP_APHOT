# Name:
#    NOD_CHOP_APHOT

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a chopped and nodded observation, and performs aperture
#    photometry.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a chopped and nodded observation, currently
#    just for Michelle data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
#    a multiple-of-four object frames to make a calibrated, untrimmed
#    mosaic automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, creation and propagation of data
#    variance, difference the integrations for each AB chop beam pair,
#    bad-pixel masking, difference adjacent nodded pairs, registers the
#    frames, and forms a mosaic.  See the "Notes" for further information.

#    The script combines and registers the various chopped and nodded
#    images of the point source and neighbouring background to form
#    to form a single image with four times the signal.  Photometry of
#    the point source using a fixed 3-arcsecond aperture is then
#    calculated.  The results appear in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt in
#    the form of a Starlink small text list.  The analysis of each star is
#    appended to this file.

# Notes:
#    -  A variance array is created for each beam, first using the read
#    noise, and once the bias is removed, Poisson noise is added.
#    -  The bias removed from each beam is currently a null bias, so the
#    errors will be overestimated in the CHOP read mode.  The data
#    array will be unaffected once the beams are differenced.  Using
#    a bias frame awaits the ARRAY_TESTS recipe to file a suitable
#    short-exposure dark as a bias in the calibration system.
#    -  The integrations of the two beams are differenced, the first
#    subtracted from the second in each pair.
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies integer shifts of origin.   There is no
#    rotation to align the Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of object frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, 
#    which has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master
#    mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also
#    summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise
#    the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  The combined source image is made by taking symmetrical areas
#    about each source, such that no pixels are duplicated.  Thus the
#    divisions occur at midpoints of the chop throw and the nod
#    separations.  These are registered using the source centroids.
#    -  The photometry tabulation includes the file name, source name,
#    time, filter, airmass, the catalogue magnitude and estimates of
#    the zero-point with and without the application of a mean
#    extinction.  There are headings at the top of each column.
#    -  The photometry uses a multiply clipped (2,2,2.5,3 standard 
#    deviations) mean to estimate the sky mode in an annulus about the
#    source.  The inner annulus diameter is 2.0 times that of the
#    aperture (6 arcsec); the outer annulus is 3.0 times (9 arcsec)
#    for Michelle.  The errors are internal, based on the sky noise.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the differenced pairs
#    _dp suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gm" for Michelle.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of object frames in

#    counts from 0.

NOD_CHOP_APHOT -- Reduces a chopped and nodded observation, and performs aperture photometry.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a chopped and nodded observation, currently
just for Michelle data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
a multiple-of-four object frames to make a calibrated, untrimmed
mosaic automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, creation and propagation of data
variance, difference the integrations for each AB chop beam pair,
bad-pixel masking, difference adjacent nodded pairs, registers the
frames, and forms a mosaic.  See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

The script combines and registers the various chopped and nodded
images of the point source and neighbouring background to form to form
a single image with four times the signal.  Photometry of the point
source using a fixed 3-arcsecond aperture is then calculated.  The
results appear in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt> in the form of a
Starlink small text list.  The analysis of each star is appended to
this file.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

A variance array is created for each beam, first using the read
noise, and once the bias is removed, Poisson noise is added.

=item *

The bias removed from each beam is currently a null bias, so the
errors will be overestimated in the CHOP read mode.  The data
array will be unaffected once the beams are differenced.  Using
a bias frame awaits the ARRAY_TESTS recipe to file a suitable
short-exposure dark as a bias in the calibration system.

=item *

The integrations of the two beams are differenced, the first
subtracted from the second in each pair.

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
transformed to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies integer shifts of origin.   There is no
rotation to align the Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of object frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass
and end UT headers are updated to match that of the last-observed
frame contributing to the mosaic.

=item *

The combined source image is made by taking symmetrical areas
about each source, such that no pixels are duplicated.  Thus the
divisions occur at midpoints of the chop throw and the nod

time, filter, airmass, the catalogue magnitude and estimates of
the zero-point with and without the application of a mean

-  The photometry uses a multiply clipped (2,2,2.5,3 standard 
deviations) mean to estimate the sky mode in an annulus about the
source.  The inner annulus diameter is 2.0 times that of the
aperture (6 arcsec); the outer annulus is 3.0 times (9 arcsec)
