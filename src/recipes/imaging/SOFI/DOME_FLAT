# Name:
#    DOME_FLAT

# Purpose:
#    Creates and files imaging flat fields derived from a dome flat.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe makes one or more flats for ESO SOFI infrared imaging
#    from a series of dome flat frames with the calibration lamp
#    alternating on then off.  A new flat is made for each combination
#    of filter.
#
#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, then differences
#    each pair of on-off frames.  It then normalises the result to a
#    mean of one.  Details of each flat are filed in the index of flats
#    for future selection and use of the flat.  See the "Notes" for
#    further details.

# Notes:
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  In addition to the four frames expected, there may be test
#    frames in the group used to adjust the lamp intensity to an
#    appropriate level.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<filter>_<group_number>_c<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent recipe cycles.  Token <filter> is the filter name,
#    <group_number> is the frame number of the group, and <cycle_number>
#    is the number of the cycle, counting from one.
#    -  The flats are filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [1]

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK
#    and KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through the intermediate file
#    to the flat.
#    -  Error propagation is controlled by the USEVAR parameter.

DOME_FLAT -- Creates and files imaging flat fields derived from a dome flat

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe makes one or more flats for ESO SOFI infrared imaging from
a series of dome flat frames with the calibration lamp alternating on
then off.  A new flat is made for each combination of filter.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, then differences
each pair of on-off frames.  It then normalises the result to a
mean of one.  Details of each flat are filed in the index of flats
for future selection and use of the flat. 
See the L<"NOTES"> for further details.

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

The created flat fields in flat_E<lt>filterE<gt>_E<lt>group_numberE<gt> for the
first or only cycle, and flat_E<lt>filterE<gt>_E<lt>group_numberE<gt>_cE<lt>cycle_numberE<gt>
for subsequent recipe cycles.  Token E<lt>filterE<gt> is the filter name,
E<lt>group_numberE<gt> is the frame number of the group, and E<lt>cycle_numberE<gt>
