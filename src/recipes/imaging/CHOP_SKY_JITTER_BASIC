# CHOP_SKY_JITTER_BASIC

# Name:
#    CHOP_SKY_JITTER_BASIC

# Purpose:
#    Basic reduction of alternating sky-target jitters using interpolated
#    sky subtraction.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description: 
#    This recipe reduces a moderately extended source using UKIRT imaging
#    data.  The data comprise alternating blank-sky and target frames
#    commencing and ending with a blank sky.  Both the sky and target
#    frames are jittered.  The recipe makes a sky-subtracted untrimmed
#    mosaic automatically.

#    The script performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field division, sky subtraction, registration
#    using telescope offsets, and mosaicking.  The "Notes" give more
#    details.

#    It is suitable for extended objects where the object fills or nearly
#    fills the frame, so sky estimation within the frame is impossible or
#    unreliable, but the extended mapping of the target is not required.

# Notes: 
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is derived from the sky frames as follows.  The
#    mode (sigma-clipped mean) is used to offset each sky frame's mode
#    to that of the first sky frame.  The corrected sky frames are
#    combined pixel by pixel using a median of the values in each
#    frame.  The resultant frame is normalised by its median to form
#    the flat field.  This frame median is subtracted from the source
#    frames after they have been flat-fielded.  A flat field is created
#    from all the jittered sky frames, and applied to all the target
#    frames.
#    -  The sky subtraction comes from linear interpolation of the sky
#    modal values of the two sky frames which immediately bracket the
#    target frame.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  There is no resampling, merely integer shifts of origin.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The noise will be greater in the mosaic's peripheral areas, having
#    received less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
#    exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  At the end of each cycle of sky and object frames the full
#    mosaic of target frames is created and displayed.  On the second and 
#    subsequent cycles the full mosaic is added into a master mosaic of
#    improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
#    stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end
#    airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of jittered target frames in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <cycle_number> counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "i" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August
#    IRCAM frames had prefix "ro".
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<filter>_<group_number>_c<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of target frames in the jitter pattern.  If this
#       is not set, a value is derived from the number of offsets, as
#       given by header NOFFSETS.  The formula is NOFFSETS / 2 - 1.
#       An error results should NOFFSETS be odd.  If neither is 
#       available, 9 is the default.  An error state arises if the
#       number of jittered frames is fewer than 3.  For observations
#       prior to the availability of full ORAC, header NOFFSETS will
#       be absent.  []

CHOP_SKY_JITTER_BASIC -- Basic reduction of alternating sky-target jitters using interpolated sky subtraction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION 

This recipe reduces a moderately extended source using UKIRT imaging
data.  The data comprise alternating blank-sky and target frames
commencing and ending with a blank sky.  Both the sky and target
frames are jittered. The recipe makes a sky-subtracted untrimmed
mosaic automatically.

The script performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
subtraction, flat-field division, sky subtraction, registration
using telescope offsets, and mosaicking.  The L<"NOTES"> give more
details.

It is suitable for extended objects where the object fills or nearly
fills the frame, so sky estimation within the frame is impossible or
unreliable, but the extended mapping of the target is not required.
