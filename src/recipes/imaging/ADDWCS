# Name:
#    ADDWCS

# Purpose:
#    Creates the valid WCS in the FITS headers of raw data.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe uses the existing hotpotch of UKIRT imaging headers of raw
#    data to make a new set of headers which define a valid world co-ordinate
#    system, using the AIPS convention.

# Notes:
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.

# Output Data:
#    -  The corrected frame in <i><date>_<obs_number>_raw,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI, "m" for Michelle,  and "i" for IRCAM.
#    If the file already exists, it's only updated.

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe uses the existing hotpotch of UKIRT imaging headers of raw
data to make a new set of headers which define a valid world
co-ordinate system, using the AIPS convention.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.

The corrected frame in

is "f" for UFTI, "m" for Michelle, and "i" for IRCAM.
If the file already exists, it's only updated.
