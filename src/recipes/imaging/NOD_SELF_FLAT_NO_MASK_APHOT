# Name:
#    NOD_SELF_FLAT_NO_MASK_APHOT

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "nod jitter" photometry observation, and performs
#    aperture photometry.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "nod jitter" photometry observation with
#    UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising a
#    multiple-of-four object frames and a dark frame to make a
#    calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, difference adjacent pairs, flat-field creation and
#    division, feature detection and matching between object frames,
#    and resampling.  See the "Notes" for further information.

#    Photometry of the point source using a fixed 5-arcsecond aperture
#    is calculated for each jitter frame and the mosaic.  The results
#    appear in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt in the form of a Starlink
#    small text list.  The analysis of each star is appended to this file.

#    This recipe works well for faint sources in moderately crowded fields.

# Notes: 
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is created by combining normalised object 
#    frames using the median at each pixel.
#    -  Registration is performed using common point sources in the
#    overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
#    objects, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of object frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, 
#    which has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master
#    mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also
#    summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise
#    the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  The photometry tabulation includes the file name, source name,
#    time, filter, airmass, the catalogue magnitude and estimates of
#    the zero-point with and without the application of a mean
#    extinction.  To discriminate between the various results, the
#    positive images have suffix "_pos" after the frame name and the 
#    negative images have a "_neg" suffix.  There are headings at the top
#    of each column.
#    -  The photometry uses a multiply clipped (2,2,2.5,3 standard 
#    deviations) mean to estimate the sky mode in an annulus about the
#    source.  This is not unduly biased by the presence of the self-flat
#    artifact in the pixel histogram.  The inner annulus diameter is 1.3 
#    times that of the aperture (6.5 arcsec); the outer annulus is 2.5
#    times (12.5 arcsec) for UFTI and twice the aperture (10 arcsec) for
#    IRCAM.  The errors are internal, based on the sky noise.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:

#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August these

NOD_SELF_FLAT_NO_MASK_APHOT -- Reduces a "nod jitter" photometry observation, and performs aperture photometry.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "nod jitter" observation with UKIRT imaging data.  It
takes an imaging observation comprising a multiple-of-four object frames
and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, difference adjacent pairs, flat-field creation and
division, feature detection and matching between object frames,
and resampling.  See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

Photometry of the point source using a fixed 5-arcsecond aperture
is calculated for each jitter frame and the mosaic.  The results
appear in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt> in the form of a Starlink
small text list.  The analysis of each star is appended to this file.

This recipe works well for faint sources in moderately crowded fields.

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item * 

For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.

The bad pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

The flat field is created by combining normalised object 
frames using the median at each pixel.

Registration is performed using common point sources in the
overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
objects, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of object frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass
and end UT headers are updated to match that of the last-observed
frame contributing to the mosaic.

=item *

The photometry tabulation includes the file name, source name, time,
filter, airmass, the catalogue magnitude and estimates of the
zero-point with and without the application of a mean extinction.  To
discriminate between the various results, the positive images have
suffix "_pos" after the frame name and the negative images have a
"_neg" suffix.  There are headings at the top of each column.

=item *

The photometry uses a multiply clipped (2,2,2.5,3 standard 
deviations) mean to estimate the sky mode in an annulus about the
source.  This is not unduly biased by the presence of the self-flat
artifact in the pixel histogram.  The inner annulus diameter is 1.3 
times that of the aperture (6.5 arcsec); the outer annulus is 2.5
times (12.5 arcsec) for UFTI and twice the aperture (10 arcsec) for
IRCAM.  The errors are internal, based on the sky noise.

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames.
