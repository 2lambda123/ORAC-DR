# Name:
#    NOD_SKY_FLAT_THERMAL

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "nod jitter" observation creating a flat from sky frames.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "nod jitter" observation with UKIRT imaging
#    data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising a
#    multiple-of-eight object frames and a dark frame to make a
#    calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, difference adjacent pairs, flat-field creation and
#    division, feature detection and matching between object frames,
#    and resampling.  See the "Notes" for further information.

#    This recipe works well for faint sources in moderately crowded fields.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is created by combining normalised sky
#    frames using the median at each pixel.  There is no cleaning
#    of extreme outliers.
#    -  Registration is performed using common point sources in the
#    overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
#    objects, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of object frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master
#    mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also
#    summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise
#    the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gu" for UIST and "gi" for IRCAM (before 2000 August this
#    was "rg").
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of object frames in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_mos<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "u" for UIST and "i" for IRCAM (before 2000 August
#    IRCAM frames had prefix "ro").
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<filter>_<group_number>_c<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the nod pattern.  If absent, the number
#       of offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS, minus one is used.  If
#       neither is available, 8 is used.  An error state arises if
#       the number of jittered frames is fewer than 8 and not a
#       multiple of 8.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK,
#    KAPPA, and FIGARO.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.

NOD_SKY_FLAT_THERMAL -- Reduces a "nod jitter" observation creating a flat from sky frames.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "nod jitter" observation with UKIRT imaging
data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising a multiple-of-eight
object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic
automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, difference adjacent pairs, flat-field creation and
division, feature detection and matching between object frames,
and resampling.  See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

This recipe works well for faint sources in moderately crowded fields.

For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with

units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
