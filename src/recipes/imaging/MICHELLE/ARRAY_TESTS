#  Name:
#    ARRAY_TESTS

#  Purpose:
#    Calculates a mean bias frame and the readnoise for Michelle.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This preliminary script calculates an approximate bias frame for
#    Michelle from a series of engineering data taken with the sequence
#    called array_tests.  This comprises four minimum-exposure darks, which
#    are effectively a bias frame.  The first two are ignored to avoid
#    artifacts these flush.  The second two are averaged and filed with
#    the calibration system.  The read noise is also derived from these
#    two.
 
# Notes:
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  The frames must be in the same group.

# Output Data:
#    -  Mean bias frame, bias_<frame_number>, where <frame_number> is
#    the last frame number.

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
