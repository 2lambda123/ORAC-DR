=head1 NAME

DIFFERENCE_STATS -- Calculates stats for Michelle darks in a pairwise manner.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is meant to be used in an array tests suite. It takes a group
of observations, subtracts pairs, then calculates and displays the standard
deviation for the resulting differenced frames.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The frames must be in the same group.

=item *

The recipe defaults to a group of twenty frames, but this can be modified
through the NUMBER parameter for the _DIFFERENCE_STATS_STEER_ primitive.
