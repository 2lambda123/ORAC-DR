#  Name:
#    DIFFERENCE_STATS

#  Purpose:
#    Calculates statistics for Michelle darks in a pairwise manner.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe is meant to be used in an array tests suite.  It takes
#    a group of observations, subtracts successive pairs, then calculates
#    and reports the standard deviation for each resulting differenced
#    frame in a central 200-pixel-square region, and in the four channels
#    of the detector.  It finally provides the average of these statistics
#    for the group as a whole.

# Notes:
#    -  The frames must be in the same group.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the group.  The default is used if
#       the number of frames is fewer than 2 or is not even. [20]

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
