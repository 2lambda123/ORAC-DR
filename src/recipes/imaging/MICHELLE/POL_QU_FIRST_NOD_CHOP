# Name:
#    POL_QU_FIRST_NOD_CHOP

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a chopped and nodded polarimetry observation, where waveplate
#    angle iterates in pairs at each jitter position.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a chopped and nodded single-beam polarimetry
#    observation, currently just for Michelle data.  The imaging
#    observation should comprise chopped object frames at the waveplate
#    angles 0, 45 degrees for each of a multiple-of-two pairs of nod
#    positions, followed by frames at waveplate angles 22.5, 67.5 degrees
#    also for each of a multiple-of-two pairs of nod positions.

#    For each waveplate angle the recipe makes automatically a calibrated,
#    untrimmed mosaic.  The recipe combines the multiple images of the
#    source within each of these mosaics into new frames, and uses those
#    four combined frames to calculate automatically calibrated
#    polarisation images and vectors of the source.  See "Output Data" for
#    a list of these images.

#    It performs a null debiassing, creation and propagation of data
#    variance, difference the integrations for each AB chop-beam pair,
#    bad-pixel masking, difference adjacent nodded pairs, registers the
#    frames, and forms a mosaic.  See the "Notes" for further information.

# Notes:
#    -  A variance array is created for each chop beam, first using the
#    read noise, and once the bias is removed, Poisson noise is added.
#    -  A bias frame selected from the calibration system is removed from
#    each beam in CHOP read mode.  If no bias frame is available
#    in the CHOP mode, the recipe subtracts a null bias, so the errors
#    will be overestimated in the CHOP read mode; the data array will
#    be unaffected once the beams are differenced.  The ARRAY_TESTS
#    recipe files a suitable short-exposure dark as a bias in the
#    calibration system.
#    -  The integrations of the two chop beams are differenced, the
#    first subtracted from the second in each pair.
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies integer shifts of origin.   There is no
#    rotation to align the Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of frames, the recipe creates mosaics for each
#    chop beam and waveplate angle (modulo 180 degrees).  Each mosaic
#    has its bad pixels filled and after the first cycle is then added
#    into its own master mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The
#    exposure time is also summed and stored in each master mosaic's
#    corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers
#    are updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  For each waveplate angle, the combined source image is made by
#    taking symmetrical areas about each source, such that no pixels
#    are duplicated.  Thus the divisions occur at midpoints of the chop
#    throw and the nod separations.  These are registered using the
#    nominal chop throws and telescope offsets.
#    -  The polarised intensity is corrected for the statistical bias
#    of the noise by subtracting the variance of Q or U.
#    -  An offset of 0.0 degrees clockwise is applied to the rotation
#    angle for the orientation of the analyser with respect to north.
#    A non-null value will be applied once it is determined.
#    -  The polarisation data for each pixel are also stored in
#    catalogues.  See "Output Data".
#    -  The intensity image may be displayed with vectors overlaid. 
#    Steps are taken to reduce the number of noisy or insignificant
#    pixels, as well as clutter.  First, the polarisation catalogue data
#    are averaged in 3-by-3-pixel bins.  Second, a binned pixel is
#    rejected if its polarisation is greater than 50% or is not positive,
#    or its polarisation signal to noise less than 3, or its polarisation
#    error is greater 5%.  The bin size and thresholds can readily be
#    changed by supplying arguments to the _CALC_STOKES_NOD_CHOP_
#    primitive.
#    -  At the end of each cycle, the grand mosaics are registered, and
#    new polarisation maps and catalogues constructed.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the differenced pairs
#    _dp suffix) frames.
