# Name:
#    JITTER_SELF_FLAT_BASIC

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation using
#    just the basic operations for speed.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
#    with near-infrared imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation
#    comprising jittered object frames and a dark frame to make a
#    calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field creation, flat-field division, integer
#    shifts of origin to register, and mosaicking.  See the "Notes"
#    for further information. 

#    This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming
#    data, and is intended for faint sources and for moderately
#    crowded fields.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is created by combining normalised object 
#    frames using the clipped median at each pixel.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  There is no resampling, merely integer shifts of origin.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
#    noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers
#    are updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM and IRIS2.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of jittered frames in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_mos<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "i" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August
#    IRCAM frames had prefix "ro". IRIS2 data are in <date><obs_number>_ff,
#    where <date> is in the form "ddmmm".
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<filter>_<group_number>_c<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern.  If not supplied
#       the number of offsets, as given by FITS header NOFFSETS, minus
#       one is used.  If neither is available, 9 is the default.  An
#       error state arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer
#       than 3.  For observations prior to the availability of full
#       ORAC, header NOFFSETS will be absent.  []

JITTER_SELF_FLAT_BASIC -- Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation using just the basic operations for speed.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation with
UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
jittered object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated,
untrimmed mosaic automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flatfield creation, flatfield division, integer
shifts of origin to register, and mosaicking.  See the "Notes"
for further information. 

This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming
data, and is intended for faint sources and for moderately
crowded fields.

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item * 

For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item * 

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

The flat field is created by combining normalised object 
frames using the clipped median at each pixel.

=item *

Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
transformed to pixels.

=item *

There is no resampling, merely integer shifts of origin.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The
exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's mosaic's
corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers are
updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing to the
mosaic.

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames.
