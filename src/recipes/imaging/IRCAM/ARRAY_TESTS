#  Name:
#    ARRAY_TESTS

#  Purpose:
#    Calculates the readout noises and dark current for IRCAM.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script calculates for IRCAM, the ND_STARE readout noise and
#    the STARE readout noise, and the dark current from eight engineering
#    frames taken with the sequence called array_tests.  The results are
#    compared with the nominal values, and you are notified whether or not
#    the values obtained are within limits.  At UKIRT, the results are also
#    logged to an engineering file for archival purposes.

# Notes:
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  The engineering log contains the UT date and time, the STARE
#    and ND_STARE readout noises, and the dark current.  The results are
#    normally appended to the log.  If for some reason it does not exist,
#    a new log is created containing the column headings.
#    -  Multiple array tests are permitted.  A new set of results is
#    reported and logged for each cycle.
#    -  Both readout noise values are filed to the calibration system.

# Output Data:
#    -  The engineering log /ukirt_sw/logs/ircam3_array_tests.log.

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.

ARRAY_TESTS -- Calculates the readout noises and dark current for IRCAM.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script calculates for IRCAM, the ND_STARE readout noise and
the STARE readout noise, and the dark current from eight engineering
frames taken with the sequence called array_tests.  The results are
compared with the nominal values, and you are notified whether or not
the values obtained are within limits.  At UKIRT, the results are also
logged to an engineering file for archival purposes.

The engineering log contains the UT date and time, the STARE
and ND_STARE readout noises, and the dark current.  The results are
normally appended to the log.  If for some reason it does not exist,
a new log is created containing the column headings.

=item *

Multiple array tests are permitted.  A new set of results is
reported and logged for each cycle.

=item *

Both readout noise values are filed to the calibration system.
