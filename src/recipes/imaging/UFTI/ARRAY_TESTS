#  Name:
#    ARRAY_TESTS

#  Purpose:
#    Calculates the readout noises and dark current for UFTI.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script calculates for UFTI the NDSTARE readout noise, and the
#    dark current from a series of four engineering frames taken
#    with the sequence called array_tests.  The results are compared with
#    the nominal values, and you are notified whether or not the values
#    obtained are within limits.  At UKIRT, the results are also logged
#    to an engineering file for archival purposes.

# Notes:
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  The engineering log contains the UT date and time, the NDSTARE
#    readout noise and the dark current.  The results are normally
#    appended to the log.  If for some reason it does not exist, a new
#    log is created containing the column headings.
#    -  Multiple array tests are permitted.  A new set of results is
#    reported and logged for each cycle.
#    -  The NDSTARE readout noise is filed in the calibration system.

# Output Data:
#    -  The engineering log $ORAC_DATA_OUT/ufti_array_tests.log.

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.

ARRAY_TESTS -- Calculates the readout noises and dark current for UFTI.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script calculates for UFTI the NDSTARE readout noise, and the
dark current from a series of four engineering frames taken
with the sequence called array_tests.  The results are compared with
the nominal values, and you are notified whether or not the values
obtained are within limits.  At UKIRT, the results are also logged
to an engineering file for archival purposes.

The engineering log contains the UT date and time, the NDSTARE readout
noise and the dark current.  The results are normally appended to the
log.  If for some reason it does not exist, a new log is created
containing the column headings.

=item *

Multiple array tests are permitted.  A new set of results is
reported and logged for each cycle.

The NDSTARE readout noise is filed in the calibration system.
