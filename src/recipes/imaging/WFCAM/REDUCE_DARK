# Name:
#    REDUCE_DARK

# Purpose:
#    Averages and files observations as the current dark.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces dark-frame observations for WFCAM data.
#    Multiple darks of the same exposure time are averaged.  It
#    files the single or averaged dark in the dark index file.  Other
#    reduction steps comprise bad-pixel masking, optional creation of
#    data errors.

# Notes:
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The name of dark is dark_<exposure_time>_<nexp>_<readmode>_<group_number>,
#    where <exposure_time> is the exposure time with decimal replaced by "p",
#    and <nexp> is the number of coadds.  For single frames the group_number 
#    is the same as the frame number.
#    -  The dark is filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.dark.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [1]

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through the intermediate file
#    to the dark.

REDUCE_DARK -- Averages and files observations as the current dark.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces dark-frame observations for WFCAM data.
Multiple darks of the same exposure time are averaged.  It
files the single or averaged dark in the dark index file.  Other
reduction steps comprise bad-pixel masking, optional creation of
data errors.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted.

=item *

Sub-arrays are supported.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The name of dark is dark_E<lt>exposure_timeE<gt>_E<lt>nexpE<gt>_E<lt>readmodeE<gt>_E<lt>group_numberE<gt>,
where E<lt>exposure_timeE<gt> is the exposure time with decimal replaced by "p",
and E<lt>nexpE<gt> is the number of coadds.  For single frames the group_number 
is the same as the frame number.

The dark is filed in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.dark>.
