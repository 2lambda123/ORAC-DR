=head1 NAME

MOVING_JITTER - Reduces a moving-target jitter observation for WFCAM.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a WFCAM jitter imaging observation of a moving
target such as an near-Eath asteroid or satellite debris. It takes an
imaging observation comprising jittered (and optionally microstepped)
object frames, a dark frame, and a predetermined flat-field frame to
make a calibrated mosaic automatically.

This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction, flat-field
division, microstep interleaving, and mosaicking.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is created
in the headers should no WCS already exist.  No refined astrometry
solution is created, since the stars are trailed, not necessarily in a
linear fashion.

=item *

The offsets between the base positions are used to align the dithered
images so that in the mosaics the moving target appears as a point source
and the stars are trailed.

=item *

A point-source catalogue is created after each interleaved frame is
created.

=item *

For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise. The
exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding
header. Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to match
that of the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
