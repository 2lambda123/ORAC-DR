=head1 NAME

FOCUS_REDUCE - Reduce a WFCAM focus observation, giving a suggested change in focus.
               Data taken in (post-April 2010) mode, using secondary to change focus

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a standard imaging focus observation for WFCAM
data. For each exposure in the focus observation, this recipe
subtracts a dark and divides by a flat. Then the recipe detects
objects in each exposure and gives a median full-width at half-max
value, then giving a suggested telescope focus position that will put
the instrument into better focus.

=item *

You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat
field. Eventually a master flat will be used.
