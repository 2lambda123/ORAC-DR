=head1 NAME

NIGHT_LOG -- Produces text file logs of a night's WFCAM observations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe takes a night's WFCAM observations and creates three text
files containing a headed tabulation of parameters for each frame.

The three files are:

=over 4

=item *

A short nightlog, containing observation number, group number, tile
number, object name, observation type, jitter position and number of
jitters in pattern, microstep position and number of microsteps in
pattern, UT start time, exposure time, filter, right ascension and
declination offsets, and data reduction recipe name.

=item *

A long nightlog, containing the same parameters as the short nightlog,
but also including the airmass, and right ascension and declination
coordinates of the observation.

=item *

A focus nightlog, containing observation number, group number, object
name, observation type, UT start time, exposure time, filter name,
telescope focus, internal focus position, focus offset, and focus
filter offset.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

Run with "oracdr -noeng -from 1 -skip" for efficiency.

=item *

This recipe is designed for WFCAM.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The text log files F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/E<lt>dateE<gt>.nightlog_E<lt>camnumE<gt>>
for the short nightlog, F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/E<lt>dateE<gt>.nightlog_E<lt>camnumE<gt>-long>
for the long nightlog, and F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/E<lt>dateE<gt>.nightlog_E<lt>camnumE<gt>-focus>
for the focus nightlog, where E<lt>dateE<gt> is the UT date in YYYYMMDD format
and E<lt>camnumE<gt> is the camera number.
