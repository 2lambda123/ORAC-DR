FOCUS_REDUCE_SKY - Reduce a WFCAM focus observation, incorporating sky
subtraction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a standard imaging sky-subtracted focus
observation sequence for WFCAM data. First, a number of sky frames are
dark-subtracted and flat-fielded. When the last sky frame is
processed, all of the sky frames are median-combined to form a master
sky. The next observation in the sequence is a focus, which is
dark-subtracted, flat-fielded, and sky-subtracted. Then the recipe
detects objects in each exposure and gives a median FWHM value, then
giving a suggested telescope focus position that will put the
instrument into better focus.
