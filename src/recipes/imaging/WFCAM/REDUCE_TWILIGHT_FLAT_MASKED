=head1 NAME

REDUCE_TWILIGHT_FLAT - Reduce WFCAM twilight flats.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces twilight flats taken by WFCAM.

It ignores any frames whose clipped mean is less than 5000 or greater
than 30000 counts. When it has a frame that meets this criterion, it
divides the frame by the clipped mean to normalize it, and then takes
all of the normalized frames in the current group with the same filter
and median combines them to create a flat field.
