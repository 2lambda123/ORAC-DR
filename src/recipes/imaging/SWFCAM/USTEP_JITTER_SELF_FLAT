USTEP_JITTER_SELFFLAT -- Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation using object masking.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation with
UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
jittered object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated,
untrimmed mosaic automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flat-field creation and division, feature
detection and matching between object frames.
See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

This recipe works well for faint sources and for moderately
crowded fields.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item * 

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item * 

The dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

The flat field is created iteratively.  First an approximate
flat-field is created by combining normalised object frames using
the median at each pixel.  This flat field is applied to the object
frames.  Sources within the flat-fielded frames are detected, and
masked in the dark-subtracted frames.  The first stage is repeated
but applied to the masked frames to create the final flat field.

=item *

Registration is performed using common point sources in the
overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
objects, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
transformed to pixels.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass
and end UT headers are updated to match that of the last-observed
frame contributing to the mosaic.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames.
