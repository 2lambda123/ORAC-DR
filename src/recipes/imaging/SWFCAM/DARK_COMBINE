=head1 NAME

DARK_COMBINE -- Averages darks in the same group to form a dark
calibration file.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces dark-frame observations with infrared imaging
data from WFCAM. Multiple darks of the same exposure time in the same
group are averaged. It files the resulting dark in the dark
index file. Other reduction steps comprise bad-pixel masking and
optional creation of data errors.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad. The lower limit is 5 standard deviations
below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1. The upper
limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted.

=item *

This recipe is essentially the same as REDUCE_DARK, but without
variance propagation.

=item *

This recipe is suitable for WFCAM.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The dark called dark_E<lt>exposure_timeE<gt>_E<lt>group_numberE<gt>.
For single frames the group number is the same as the frame number.
The decimal point in the exposure time is replaced by "p".

=item *

The dark is filed in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.dark>.

=head1 CONFIGURABLE STEERING PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item USEVAR = LOGICAL

Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays. For WFCAM
this defaults to false. [0]
