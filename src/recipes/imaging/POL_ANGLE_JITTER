# Name:
#    POL_ANGLE_JITTER

# Purpose:
#    Reduces an imaging polarimetry observation, where waveplate angle
#    iterates at each jitter position.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a polarimetry observation with UKIRT imaging
#    data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising object frames
#    at the four waveplate angles 0, 45, 22.5, 67.5 degrees for each of
#    of a series of jitter positions offset in Right Ascension; and a
#    dark frame to make calibrated polarisation images and vectors
#    automatically.  See "Output Data" for a list of these images.
#
#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction
#    and flat-field division on all frames.  Next the sections of the frame
#    representing the e- and o-beam target and sky regions are extracted,
#    and the target frames sky-subtracted.  The resultant frames undergo
#    registration and resampling to form a mosaic for each waveplate angle
#    and beam.  Once all eight mosaics are formed they are registered and
#    resampled, and then combined to form the various polarisation images.
#    The polarisation data are binned and noisy data excluded from
#    a final catalogue of vectors.  See the "Notes" for details.
#
#    This recipe works well for point sources, and for extended sources
#    whose sizes in Right Ascension and Declination are less than about
#    35 and 15 arcseconds respectively for UFTI, or 9 and 4 arcseconds
#    for IRCAM.  Objects which would appear in both the target and
#    sky regions, i.e. Declination extents south of the centre
#    larger than 35 arcseconds (UFTI) or 8 arcseconds (IRCAM), should
#    use recipe POL_EXTENDED for best results.

# Notes: 
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  Data errors are propagated through all processing steps.
#    The initial values are found by applying the nominal ADU conversion
#    and read noise.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  You should use SKY_FLAT_POL or SKY_FLAT_POL_ANGLE to make the
#    flat fields.
#    -  The target regions are 30% to 70% of the frame width about
#    the Right-ascension centre, i.e. roughly centred on the source.
#    The current sky limits are 1% to 99% of the frame width along the
#    Right-ascension axis.  The Declination pixel limits are instrument
#    dependent, and are as follows.  For UFTI, o sky: 69--264;
#    e sky: 320--484; o target: 601--764; e target: 824--988.  For
#    IRCAM, o sky: 12--52; e sky: 67--107; o target: 152--192;
#    e target: 207--247.
#    -  The sky subtraction for a beam uses a constant modal sky level
#    from the corresponding sky region.
#    -  Registration is performed using common point sources in the
#    overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
#    objects for automatic registration, the recipe matches the centroid
#    of central source within an 8-arcsecond box.  Should that fail for
#    the jittered e- and o-beam sections, the recipe resorts to using the
#    telescope offsets transformed to pixels.  However, the final option
#    for registering the e and o-beam mosaics at different waveplate
#    angles, uses the beam offsets in arcseconds for the current filter 
#    converted to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the few pixels in the peripheral areas
#    having received less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by
#    its exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of twelve frames, the recipe creates mosaics
#    for each beam and waveplate angle.  Each mosaic has its bad pixels
#    filled and after the first cycle is then added into its own master
#    mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also
#    summed and stored in each master mosaic's corresponding header. 
#    Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to match
#    that of the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  The polarised intensity is corrected for the statistical bias
#    of the noise by subtracting the variance of Q or U.
#    -  An offset of 6.3 degrees clockwise is applied to the rotation
#    angle for the orientation of the analyser with respect to north.
#    -  The polarisation data for each pixel are also stored in
#    catalogues.  See "Output Data".
#    -  The intensity image may be displayed with vectors overlaid. 
#    Steps are taken to reduce the number of noisy or insignificant
#    pixels, as well as clutter.  First, the polarisation catalogue data
#    are averaged in 3-by-3-pixel bins.  Second, a binned pixel is
#    rejected if its polarisation is greater than 50% or is not positive,
#    or its polarisation signal to noise less than 3, or its polarisation
#    error is greater 5%.  The bin size and thresholds can readily be
#    changed by supplying arguments to the _CALC_STOKES_ primitive.
#    -  At the end of each cycle, the grand mosaics are registered, and
#    new polarisation maps and catalogues constructed.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames and the mosaics (_mos or _mos_c<cycle_number> suffix).

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_<beam><angle>_mos,
#    where <m> is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively.  Token <beam> is "e" or "o";
#    and <angle> is "0", "22", "45", or "67".

#    -  Polarisation frames <m><date>_<group_number>_<suffix>, each with a

#    the Stokes parameters, the percentage polarisation, the polarisation
#    angle and intensity.  There are additional columns giving the

POL_ANGLE_JITTER -- Reduces an imaging polarimetry observation, where waveplate angle iterates at each jitter position.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a polarimetry observation with UKIRT imaging
data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising object frames
at the four waveplate angles 0, 45, 22.5, 67.5 degrees for each of
of a series of jitter positions offset in Right Ascension; and a
dark frame to make calibrated polarisation images and vectors
automatically.  See L<"OUTPUT DATA"> for a list of these images.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction
and flat-field division on all frames.  Next the sections of the frame
representing the e- and o-beam target and sky regions are extracted,
and the target frames sky-subtracted.  The resultant frames undergo
registration and resampling to form a mosaic for each waveplate angle
and beam.  Once all eight mosaics are formed they are registered and
resampled, and then combined to form the various polarisation images.
The polarisation data are binned and noisy data excluded from
a final catalogue of vectors.  See the L<"NOTES"> for details.

This recipe works well for point sources, and for extended sources
whose sizes in Right Ascension and Declination are less than about
35 and 15 arcseconds respectively for UFTI, or 9 and 4 arcseconds
for IRCAM.  Objects which would appear in both the target and
sky regions, i.e. Declination extents south of the centre
larger than 35 arcseconds (UFTI) or 8 arcseconds (IRCAM), should
use recipe L<POL_EXTENDED|POL_EXTENDED> for best results.

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

You should use L<SKY_FLAT_POL|SKY_FLAT_POL> or
L<SKY_FLAT_POL_ANGLE|SKY_FLAT_POL_ANGLE> to make the flat fields.

=item *

The target regions are 30% to 70% of the frame width about
the Right-ascension centre, i.e. roughly centred on the source.
The current sky limits are 1% to 99% of the frame width along the
Right-ascension axis.  The Declination pixel limits are instrument
dependent, and are as follows.  For UFTI, o sky: 69--264;
e sky: 320--484; o target: 601--764; e target: 824--988.  For
IRCAM, o sky: 12--52; e sky: 67--107; o target: 152--192;
e target: 207--247.

=item *

The sky subtraction for a beam uses a constant modal sky level
from the corresponding sky region.

=item *

Registration is performed using common point sources in the
overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
objects for automatic registration, the recipe matches the centroid
of central source within an 8-arcsecond box.  Should that fail for
the jittered e- and o-beam sections, the recipe resorts to using the
telescope offsets transformed to pixels.  However, the final option
for registering the e and o-beam mosaics at different waveplate
angles, uses the beam offsets in arcseconds for the current filter 
converted to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the few pixels in the peripheral areas
having received less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by
its exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of twelve frames, the recipe creates mosaics for each
beam and waveplate angle.  Each mosaic has its bad pixels filled and
after the first cycle is then added into its own master mosaic of
improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
stored in each master mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end
airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.

=item *

The polarised intensity is corrected for the statistical bias
of the noise by subtracting the variance of Q or U.

=item *

An offset of 6.3 degrees clockwise is applied to the rotation
angle for the orientation of the analyser with respect to north.

=item *

The polarisation data for each pixel are also stored in
catalogues.  See L<"OUTPUT DATA">.

=item *

The intensity image may be displayed with vectors overlaid. 
Steps are taken to reduce the number of noisy or insignificant
pixels, as well as clutter.  First, the polarisation catalogue data
are averaged in 3-by-3-pixel bins.  Second, a binned pixel is
rejected if its polarisation is greater than 50% or is not positive,
or its polarisation signal to noise less than 3, or its polarisation
error is greater 5%.  The bin size and thresholds can readily be
changed by supplying arguments to the L<_CALC_STOKES_|_CALC_STOKES_>
primitive.

=item *

At the end of each cycle, the grand mosaics are registered, and
new polarisation maps and catalogues constructed.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames and the mosaics (_mos, or _mos_cE<lt>cycle_numberE<gt>
suffix).
