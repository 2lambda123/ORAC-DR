# Name:
#    REDUCE_DARK

# Purpose:
#    File an observation as the current dark.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces a dark-frame observation with infrared imaging
#    data.  It files the dark in the dark index file.  Reduction 
#    comprises bad-pixel masking, and optional creation of data errors.

# Notes:
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The dark is called dark_<frame_number>.
#    -  The dark is filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.dark.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [1]

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through the intermediate file
#    to the dark.

REDUCE_DARK -- File an observation as the current dark.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a dark-frame observation with UKIRT imaging
data.  It files the dark in the dark index file.  Reduction 
comprises bad-pixel masking, and optional creation of data errors.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item * 

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted.

=item *

Sub-arrays are supported.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The dark called dark_E<lt>frame_numberE<gt>.

=item *

The dark is filed in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.dark>.

Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [1]

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

The title of the data is propagated through the intermediate file
to the dark.
