# Name:
#    NIGHT_LOG

# Purpose:
#    Produces a text file log of a night's imaging observations.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe takes a night's imaging observations, and creates a
#    text file containing a headed tabulation of parameters for each frame. 
#
#    The parameters are: observation number, group number, object name,
#    observation type, UT start time, exposure time, number of coadds,
#    read mode and speed, filter, start airmass, frame dimensions in
#    pixels, base equatorial co-ordinates, and data-reduction recipe name.
# 
# Notes:
#    -  Run with "oracdr -noeng -from 1 -skip"  for efficiency.
#    -  The <date> comes from the internal header ORAC_UTDATE.
#    -  Specification provided by Sandy Leggett.

# Output Data:
#    -  The text log file $ORAC_DATA_IN/<date>.nightlog, where
#    <date> is the UT date.

NIGHT_LOG -- Produces a text file log of a night's imaging observations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe takes a night's imaging observations, and creates a text file
containing a headed tabulation of parameters for each frame. 

The parameters are: observation number, group number, object name,
observation type, UT start time, exposure time, number of coadds, read
mode and speed, filter, start airmass, frame dimensions in pixels,
base equatorial co-ordinates, and data-reduction recipe name.

=item *

The E<lt>dateE<gt> comes from the internal header ORAC_UTDATE.

The text log file F<$ORAC_DATA_IN/E<lt>dateE<lt>.nightlog>, where
E<lt>dateE<gt> is the UT date.
