# Name:

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a 9-point "standard jitter" photometry observation using
#    object masking, and telescope offsets for registration.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
#    with IRCAM data.  It takes an observation comprising nine
#    object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed
#    mosaic automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field creation and division, registration
#    using telescope offsets, and resampling.

#    This recipe works well for faint sources and for moderately
#    crowded fields.  It is also using for observations that track a
#    moving object.

# Notes: 
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  The flat field is created iteratively.  First an approximate
#    flat-field is created by combining normalised object frames using
#    the median at each pixel.  This flat field is applied to the object
#    frames.  Sources within the flat-fielded frames are detected, and
#    masked in the dark-subtracted frames.  The first stage is repeated
#    but applied to the masked frames to create the final flat field.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of nine, the recipe creates a mosaic, which has
#    its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
#    improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
#    stored in the mosaic's EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass
#    header, AMEND, is updated to match that of the last-observed frame
#    contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in rg<date>_<group_number>_mos.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of nine in
#    rg<date>_<group_number>_mos_<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in ro<date>_<obs_number>_ff.
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<group_number>subgrp for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<group_number>subgrp_<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:

#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern. [9]

# Timing:

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK

#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.

JITTER9_SELF_FLAT_TELE -- Reduces a 9-point "standard jitter" photometry observation using object masking,
and telescope offsets for registration.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
with IRCAM data.  It takes an observation comprising nine
object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed
mosaic automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flat-field creation and division, registration
using telescope offsets, and resampling.

This recipe works well for faint sources and for moderately
crowded fields.  It is also using for observations that track a
moving object.

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

The flat field is created iteratively.  First an approximate
flat-field is created by combining normalised object frames using
the median at each pixel.  This flat field is applied to the object
frames.  Sources within the flat-fielded frames are detected, and
masked in the dark-subtracted frames.  The first stage is repeated
but applied to the masked frames to create the final flat field.

=item *

Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
transformed to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of nine, the recipe creates a mosaic, which has
its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
stored in the mosaic's EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass
header, AMEND, is updated to match that of the last-observed frame
contributing to the mosaic.

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames.
