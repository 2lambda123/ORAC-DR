# Name:
#    JITTER_SELF_FLAT_BASIC

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation using
#    just the basic operations for speed.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
#    with UFTI or IRCAM data.  It takes an imaging observation
#    comprising jittered object frames and a dark frame to make a
#    calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field creation, flat-field division, integer
#    shifts of origin to register, and mosaicking.  See the "Notes"
#    for further information. 

#    This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming
#    data, and is intended for faint sources and for moderately
#    crowded fields.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  The flat field is created by combining normalised object 
#    frames using the clipped median at each pixel.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  There is no resampling, merely integer shifts of origin.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise.
#    The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's EXP_TIME
#    (UFTI) or DEXPTIME (IRCAM) header.  Likewise the end airmass header,
#    AMEND, is updated to match that of the last-observed frame
#    contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "g" for UFTI and "rg" for IRCAM.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of jittered frames in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_mos<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "ro" for IRCAM.
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<group_number>subgrp for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<group_number>subgrp_<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern.  If not supplied
#       the number of offsets, as given by FITS header NOFFSETS, minus
#       one is used.  If neither is available, 9 is the default.  An
#       error state arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer
#       than 3.  For observations prior to the availability of full
#       ORAC, header NOFFSETS will be absent.  []

# Timing:

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK
#    KAPPA, and PISA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.

JITTER_SELF_FLAT_BASIC -- Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation using just the basic operations for speed.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation with
UFTI or IRCAM data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
jittered object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated,
untrimmed mosaic automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flatfield creation, flatfield division, integer
shifts of origin to register, and mosaicking.  See the "Notes"
for further information. 

This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming
data, and is intended for faint sources and for moderately
crowded fields.

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity

The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
