# Name:
#    SKY_AND_JITTER5_APHOT

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a 5-point "combined jitter" photometry observation, and
#    performs aperture photometry.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "combined jitter" photometry observation
#    with IRCAM data.  It takes an IRCAM observation comprising a one or
#    more sets of frames, each set containing a sky frame, followed by
#    five object frames; and a pre-determined flat-field frame to make
#    a calibrated, trimmed mosaic automatically.

#    This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, sky
#    subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
#    between object frames, and resampling.  See the notes for details.

#    Photometry of the point source using a fixed 6 arcsecond aperture
#    is calculated for each jitter frame and the mosaic.  The results
#    appear in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt in the form of a Starlink
#    small text list.  The analysis of each star is appended to this file.

#    This recipe is suitable for moderately faint point sources.

# Notes:
#    -  You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  The most-recent sky frame is used for the sky subtraction. 
#    -  Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
#    the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
#    to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
#    give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.  The
#    mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time (that being the
#    exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of five, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
#    is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise.
#    The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass header, AMEND, is
#    updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing to
#    the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The resultant mosaic in rg<date>_<group_number>_mos.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in ro<date>_<obs_number>_ff.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern. [5]

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK
#    and KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Error propagation is not used.

SKY_AND_JITTER5_APHOT -- Reduces a 5-point "combined jitter" photometry observation, and performs aperture photometry.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "combined jitter" photometry observation
with IRCAM data.  It takes an IRCAM observation comprising a one or
more sets of frames, each set containing a sky frame, followed by
five object frames; and a pre-determined flat-field frame to make
a calibrated, trimmed mosaic automatically.

This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, sky
subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
between object frames, and resampling.  See the notes for details.

Photometry of the point source using a fixed 6 arcsecond aperture
is calculated for each jitter frame and the mosaic.  The results
appear in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt> in the form of a Starlink
small text list.  The analysis of each star is appended to this file.

This recipe is suitable for moderately faint point sources.

You may use L<SKY_FLAT|SKY_FLAT> or L<SKY_FLAT_MASKED|SKY_FLAT_MASKED>
to make the flat field.

The bad pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

The most-recent sky frame is used for the sky subtraction.

Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.

bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.  The
