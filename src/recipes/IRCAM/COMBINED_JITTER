=head1  Name:
     COMBINED_JITTER

=head1  Purpose:
     Reduces a "bright_standard" photometry observation.

=head1  Language:
     perl5

=head1  Description:
     This script reduces a "combined jitter" photometry observation
     with IRCAM3 data.  It takes an IRCAM observation comprising a
     series of object frames and a dark frame with a predetermined
     sky and flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic
     automatically.

     It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, sky subtraction,
     flatfield division, feature detection and matching between object
     frames, resampling, and mosaicking.  The resampling comprises
     shifts of origin and rotation to align the y axis north-south.

# Startup
# =======
#
# Every recipe must do this.
    _IRCAM_HELLO_

# This gets done for the first frame in sequence
    _COMBINED_JITTER_HELLO_

# Calibration
# ===========
#
# The following operations are preformed for every appropriate frame.

# Apply the bad pixel mask.
    _MASK_BAD_PIXELS_

# Remove the bias.
    _REMOVE_BIAS_

# File the first frame as a blank-sky calibration.
    _FILE_SKY_COMBINED_JITTER_

# Subtract the sky frame.
    _SUBTRACT_SKY_COMBINED_JITTER_

# Flat field using a pre-existing calibration frame.
    _DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_

# Make mosaic
# ===========

# Determine the linear offsets between the object frames in the group
# by pattern matching common features.  Register the frames using a shift
# of pixel origin.
    _GENERATE_OFFSETS_

# Apply rotation, resample each frame, and tesselate.  The mosaic is
# trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.
    _MAKE_MOSAIC_
