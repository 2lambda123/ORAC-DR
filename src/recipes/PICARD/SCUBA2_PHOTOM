=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_PHOTOM - Perform aperture photometry on SCUBA-2 images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perform aperture photometry on SCUBA-2 images using the chosen
method. There are three methods:

=over 2

=item 1

Use the Starlink C<AUTOPHOTOM> package to perform aperture photometry
using the given aperture and annulus dimensions (default). The default
aperture radius is 30 arcsec.

=item 2

Calculate the sum within a given aperture, correcting for any DC offset
by analyzing the image outside the aperture.

=item 3

As above, but estimate the background offset using an annulus (see the
parameters B<ANNULUS_INNER> and B<ANNULUS_OUTER> below).

=back

The results are written to a log file called C<log.flux>.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

It is assumed that the images can be used B<as is> with no further
requirement for cropping or background removal.

=item *

Input data should be calibrated - the recipe does not apply any
calibration.

=back

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<ANNULUS>

Flag to denote whether to use an annulus for background estimation.

=item B<ANNULUS_INNER>

Inner radius for annulus as a multiplier of the aperture radius.

=item B<ANNULUS_OUTER>

Outer radius for annulus as a multiplier of the aperture radius.

=item B<APERTURE_RADIUS>

Radius of aperture in arcsec for calculating total flux.

=item B<AUTOPHOTOM>

Flag to denote whether to use the C<autophotom> package for photometry.

=item B<REGISTER_DEC>

Declination of position of aperture (DD:MM:SS format).

=item B<REGISTER_RA>

Right ascension of position of aperture (HH:MM:SS format).

=item B<STATS_ESTIMATOR>

Background estimator for aperture photometry. Default is C<median>.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

None.
