=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_CHECK_RMS - Calculate RMS and NEFD via two methods to compare with ITC

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculate the RMS and NEFD from an input image to compare with the
integration time calculator (ITC). The corresponding quick-look log
file are read, if they exist, to obtain NEPs from which RMS and NEFD
values may also be derived.

The average NEP and its standard deviation are determined for the
observation corresponding to the current file. The FCF is used to
convert that to an NEFD and thus an RMS using the length of the
observation. The RMS for the map is derived from its error component,
and the NEFD computed from this and the exposure time image. Finally
the ITC is used to determine the expected noise and NEFD for the
integration (elapsed) time.

The results are written to a log file, C<log.checkrms>.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The input map is trimmed to a circle 90 arcsec in radius unless
otherwise specified by the recipe parameter below.

=item *

The input files must correspond to single observations, not coadds,
because the elapsed time cannot be calculated for coadds. The recipe
will print an error if it detects that the input data have been
coadded/mosaicked.

=item * The input data are calibrated in mJy/beam if necessary.

=head1 DISPLAY

None.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<KEEPFILES>

Flag to denote whether to delete intermediate files. Default is to
keep all intermediates. If set to 1, then only the cropped files will
be kept (with suffix C<_crop>). If set to 0 then all intermediate
files will be deleted.

=item B<MAP_RADIUS>

Radius of map in arcsec. Default is 90.

=item B<STATS_ESTIMATOR>

Estimator for NEFD and RMS values derived from map. May be C<mean> or
C<median> (default).
