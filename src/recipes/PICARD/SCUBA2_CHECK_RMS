=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_CHECK_RMS - calculate RMS and NEFD via two methods to compare with ITC

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reads the corresponding quick-look log file for NEPs, and
calculates the RMS and NEFD to compare with the integration time
calculator (ITC).

The average NEP and its standard deviation are determined for the
observation corresponding to the current file. The FCF is used to
convert that to an NEFD and thus an RMS using the length of the
observation. The RMS for the map is derived from its error component,
and the NEFD computed from this and the exposure time image. Finally
the ITC is used to determine the expected noise and NEFD for the
integration (elapsed) time.

The results are written to a log file, C<log.checkrms>.

=head1 NOTES

The input map is trimmed to a circle 90 arcsec in radius unless
otherwise specified by the recipe parameter below.

=head1 DISPLAY

None.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following recipe parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 2

=item MAP_RADIUS

Radius of map in arcsec. Default is 90.

=item STATS_ESTIMATOR

Estimator for NEFD and RMS values derived from map. May be C<mean> or
C<median> (default).
