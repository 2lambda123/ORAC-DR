=head1 NAME

CROP_JCMT_IMAGES - Trim images to the defined map area

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple PICARD recipe to trim images from SCUBA-2 or ACSIS. The image
may be trimmed using given spatial dimensions or a statistical
estimator to threshold the image. In the former case, the output map
is rectangular or circular; in the latter the shape is determined by
the values in the image itself.

By default the method employs the map parameters in the FITS
header. The map width and height may be overridden with recipe
parameters. Note that if a map radius is given, in order to produce a
circular output image, the height and width are ignored.

Uses the JCMT::MapArea Perl module to define a (rectangular) AST Region
using the map parameters in the FITS header.

For the statistical estimator, the default is to trim the map
excluding data where the exposure time is less than half of the median
value.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

Creates output file with suffix C<_crop>, one for each input file.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item CROP_METHOD

Method to use for cropping image. May be C<statistical> or C<spatial>,
each of which may be abbreviated to the first four characters.

=item MAP_HEIGHT

Height of output image in arcsec.

=item MAP_RADIUS

Radius of output image in arcsec. Overrides existence of C<MAP_HEIGHT>
and C<MAP_WIDTH>.

=item MAP_WIDTH

Width of output image in arcsec.

=item STATS_COMP

NDF component to use to define the threshold. May be C<texp> to use
the exposure time image, or C<var> or C<err> to use the variance or
error components.

=item STATS_ESTIMATOR

Statistical estimator for thresholding the image. May be C<MEAN>,
C<MEDIAN>, C<MODE>, C<MAX>, C<MIN>.

=item STATS_THRESH

Multiplier for C<STATS_ESTIMATOR> above. Default is 1 if not specified.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

No display is used by this recipe.
