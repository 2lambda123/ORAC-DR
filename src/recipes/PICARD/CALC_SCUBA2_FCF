=head1 NAME

CALC_SCUBA2_FCF - Calculate FCFs from SCUBA-2 calibrators

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculate the FCF from reduced SCUBA-2 images of calibration
sources. Known calibrators will be recognized and the appropriate flux
for the current wavelength will be used. Users may also derive FCFs
from non-standard sources provided an input flux is given. See the
notes and the description of the recipe parameters for further details.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The input data should be uncalibrated (units of pW). (Calibrated data
files may be restored to an uncalibrated state by using the recipe
L<UNCALIBRATE_SCUBA2_DATA|UNCALIBRATE_SCUBA2_DATA>.)

=item *

The results of the calculation are printed to the screen and written
to two log files, C<log.fcf> which contains the FCFs along with their
estimated uncertainties, and C<log.fit_fcf> which contains the
parameters derived from the fits to the source.

=item *

Fluxes for non-standard sources may be specified by the B<FLUX_850> or
B<FLUX_450> parameter.

=item *

Multiple non-standard sources may be processed by the recipe by
appending the source name to the relevant flux. The source name should
be in upper case with spaces removed. For example,
B<FLUX_850.DGTAU>. If source names are not appended, the same flux
will be used for all.

=item *

Currently there is no way to specify peak and total fluxes separately
for user-provided sources.

=item *

Specifying fluxes for multiple sources will generate a warning about
unsupported recipe parameters for all the sources B<not> being
processed with the current pass through the recipe. These warnings can
safely be ignored.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following recipe parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 4

=item B<APERTURE_RADIUS>

Radius of aperture (in arcsec) for masking out source (otherwise 30
arcsec).

=item B<AUTOPHOTOM>

A flag to indicate whether to use KAPPA C<autophotom> for aperture
photometry. If not specified, C<autophotom> will be used. If false,
the aperture photometry is carried out using a less-optimized
method. Leaving this parameter as the default is highly recommended.

=item B<AUTOPHOTOM_INNER>

Scale factor (in terms of aperture radius) for inner radius of annulus
used for background estimate (default is 1.25).

=item B<AUTOPHOTOM_OUTER>

Scale factor for outer radius of annulus used for background estimate
(default is 2).

=item B<FLUX_450>

Source flux density at 450 um in Jy. Source-specific values may be
given by appending the source name in upper case with spaces removed.

=item B<FLUX_850>

Source flux density at 850 um in Jy. Source-specific values may be
given by appending the source name in upper case with spaces removed.

=item B<KEEPFILES>

Flag to indicate whether to delete intermediate files created by the
recipe. Default is to keep all files.

=item B<LOGFILE>

Flag to denote whether to write results to a log file at the end of
processing. Default is 1 (write a log file).

=head1 DISPLAY

No display is used by this recipe.
