=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_MAPSTATS - report image statistics and calibrator analysis

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perform basic image analysis for input maps, plus determine beam size
and FCFs from calibrators.

The results are written to the log files C<log.mapstats> and
C<log.calstats> (known calibrators only).

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The image statistics are calculated over he area defined by the map
size in the FITS header.

=item *

The input files must correspond to single observations, not coadds,
because the elapsed time cannot be calculated for coadds. The recipe
will print an error if it detects that the input data have been
coadded/mosaicked.

=item *

The results are quoted in the same units as the input file. Note,
however, the log file will contain the units corresponding to the
B<first> entry.

=item *

See also L<SCUBA2_CHECK_CAL|SCUBA2_CHECK_CAL> and
L<SCUBA2_CHECK_RMS|SCUBA2_CHECK_RMS>.

None.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<STATS_ESTIMATOR>

Estimator for exposure time, NEFD and RMS values derived from map. May
be C<mean> or C<median> (default).
