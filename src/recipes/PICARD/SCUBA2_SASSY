=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_SASSY - Analyze a single SASSy field

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Analyze individual maps of SASSy fields, combine them into a single
coadd and apply a matched filter before running a source-detection
algorithm. Detected sources are written to a C<CUPID> catalogue file
with suffix C<_cat>. Statistics are written to a log file called
C<log.sassy>.

The statistics are calculated within the area defined by the
C<MAP_HGHT> and C<MAP_WDTH> FITS headers, or by equivalent recipe
parameters (below).

See the documentation for the
L<SCUBA2_MATCHED_FILTER|SCUBA2_MATCHED_FILTER> recipe for
matched-filter-specific parameters which may also be specified.

=head1 NOTES

The image is trimmed to a circle of radius 4500 arcsec before applying
the matched filter.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<CROP_METHOD>

Method to use for cropping image. May be C<statistical>, C<rectangle>
(default) or C<circle>, each of which may be abbreviated to the first
four characters.

=item B<LOGFILE>

A flag to indicate whether or not a log file (called C<log.sassy>)
should be written to disk. Default is 1 (yes).

=item B<MAP_HEIGHT>

Map height in arcsec. Default is to use the value in the FITS header.

=item B<MAP_RADIUS>

Radius of output image in arcsec. Overrides existence of C<MAP_HEIGHT>
and C<MAP_WIDTH>.

=item B<MAP_WIDTH>

Map width in arcsec. Default is to use the value in the FITS header.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

None.
