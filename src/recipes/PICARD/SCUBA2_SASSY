=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_SASSY - Recipe to analyze a single SASSy field

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A PICARD recipe to analyze individual maps of SASSy fields, combine
them into a single coadd and apply a matched filter before running a
source-detection algorithm. Detected sources are written to a C<CUPID>
catalogue file with suffix C<_cat>. Statistics are written to a log
file called C<log.sassy>.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item LOGFILE

A flag to indicate that the PSF created by this recipe should remain
on disk after processing. If not specified, the PSF will be deleted if
one is created. This parameter is ignored if a PSF file is given (see
C<PSF_MATCHFILTER>).

=item MAP_HEIGHT

Name of an NDF file containing a suitable PSF. Must exist in the
current working directory. If not specified, the recipe will calculate
one itself for each input file.

=item MAP_WIDTH

Normalization scheme used for the PSF created by this recipe if one is
not specified using the above parameter. Maybe be C<PEAK> or C<SUM> to
indicate whether the Gaussian PSF should have a peak of unity or a sum
of unity. If not specified, the recipe assumes C<PEAK>.

=back

See the documentation for the
L<SCUBA2_MATCHED_FILTER|SCUBA2_MATCHED_FILTER> recipe for
matched-filter-specific parameters which may also be specified.

=head1 NOTES

None.

=head1 DISPLAY

No display is used by this recipe.
