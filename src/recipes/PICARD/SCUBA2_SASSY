=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_SASSY - analyze a single SASSy field

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A PICARD recipe to analyze individual maps of SASSy fields, combine
them into a single coadd and apply a matched filter before running a
source-detection algorithm. Detected sources are written to a C<CUPID>
catalogue file with suffix C<_cat>. Statistics are written to a log
file called C<log.sassy>.

The statistics are calculated within the area defined by the
C<MAP_HGHT> and C<MAP_WDTH> FITS headers, or by equivalent recipe
parameters (below).

See the documentation for the
L<SCUBA2_MATCHED_FILTER|SCUBA2_MATCHED_FILTER> recipe for
matched-filter-specific parameters which may also be specified.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item LOGFILE

A flag to indicate whether or not a log file (called C<log.sassy>)
should be written to disk. Default is 1 (yes).

=item MAP_HEIGHT

Map height in arcsec. Default is to use the value in the FITS header.

=item MAP_WIDTH

Map width in arcsec. Default is to use the value in the FITS header.

=back

=head1 NOTES

None.

=head1 DISPLAY

No display is used by this recipe.
