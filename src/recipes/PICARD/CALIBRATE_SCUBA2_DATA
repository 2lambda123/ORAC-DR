CALIBRATE_SCUBA2_DATA - Calibrate SCUBA-2 data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple PICARD recipe to calibrate SCUBA-2 data. The units of the
input data are checked and the appropriate default FCF chosen. The
output files have a suffix of C<_cal>.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following recipe parameters are supported:

=over 2

=item B<FCF>

FCF to use to calculate data. The same value is used for all
files. The standard SCUBA-2 FCF will be used if not given.

=item B<FCF_CALTYPE>

FCF type for determining the output units. May be C<BEAM> (default) or C<ARCSEC>

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

=over 2

=item *

Creates an output file for each calibrated input file with suffix
C<_cal>.
