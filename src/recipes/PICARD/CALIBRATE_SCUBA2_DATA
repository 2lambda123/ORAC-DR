=head1 NAME

CALIBRATE_SCUBA2_DATA - Calibrate SCUBA-2 data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calibrate SCUBA-2 data with a given or default FCF. The units of the
input data are checked and the appropriate default FCF chosen. The
output files have a suffix of C<_cal>.

This recipe may be used to convert between different (known)
calibration types, e.g., from mJy/arcsec**2 to mJy/beam and vice
versa.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following recipe parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<FCF>

FCF to use to calculate data. The same value is used for all
files. The standard SCUBA-2 FCF will be used if not given.

=item B<FCF_CALTYPE>

FCF type for determining the output units. May be C<BEAM> (default) or C<ARCSEC>

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

=over 2

=item *

Creates an output file for each calibrated input file with suffix
C<_cal>.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The input data must not have the same units as the desired calibration.

=item *

All input data will have the same calibration applied.

=item *

The FCF FITS header will be updated with the value used to calibrate
the data. The units will be in the comment.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

None.
