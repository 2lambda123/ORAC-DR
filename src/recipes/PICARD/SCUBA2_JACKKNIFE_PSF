=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_JACKKNIFE_PSF - Create a scaled PSF from maps with fake sources added

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe combines a series of maps that have had artificial
gaussians added in and scales the coadd using information about the
original scaling to enable the FCF to be corrected for filtering in
the map-maker.

The input files should be those created by a call to the SCUBA-2
pipeline recipe
L<REDUCE_SCAN_FAINT_POINT_SOURCES_JACKKNIFE|REDUCE_SCAN_FAINT_POINT_SOURCES_JACKKNIFE>
(or one of its aliases) that have had the artificial gaussian added at
the map-making stage. These will have a suffix of C<_mappsf>.

The PSF is scaled using a factor read from the FITS headers of the
input files if available, or from a recipe parameter (see below).

This PSF may then be given to L<SCUBA2_JACKKNIFE|SCUBA2_JACKKNIFE>
via the recipe parameter
C<PSF_MATCHFILTER>.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

Care should be taken to use the (C<_mappsf>) files that correspond to
the signal maps.

=item *

The output PSF has suffix C<_effpsf>.

=item *

To ensure consistency, the PSF scaling factor in the FITS header takes
precedence over a value derived from any given recipe parameters.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following recipe parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<FAKEMAP_CONSTSNR>

A flag to indicate whether the scale factor below should be scaled by
the square-root of the number of files. Should be left unset unless it
was also specified when the ORAC-DR recipe was originally run.

=item B<FAKEMAP_SCALE>

Amplitude of the fake source (in Jy) added to the timeseries to assess
the map-making response to a point source.

=head1 DISPLAY

None.
