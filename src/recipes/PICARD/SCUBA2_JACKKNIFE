=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_JACKKNIFE - Calculate optimal map using jack-knife noise estimator

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use a jack-knife method to remove residual low-spatial frequency noise
and create an optimal match-filtered output map. The recipe proceeds
as follows:

=over 2

=item *

The input images are coadded to produce a total signal map.

=item *

The observations are divided into two groups (with alternate files
going into each group) which are coadded separately. These coadds are
subtracted from one another to create the C<jack-knife> map.

=item *

The azimuthally-average angular power spectrum of the jack-knife map
(which should consist purely of noise) is calculated and used to
remove residual low-spatial frequency noise from the signal map and
the given (map-filtered) psf. This is the so-called C<whitening> step
(because it produces a map which has a noise power spectrum that is
white).

=item *

The whitened signal map is processed with a matched filter using the
whitened psf image as the psf.

=item *

The jack-knife map is also whitened and processed with the matched
filter. This map should consist purely of noise.

=item *

Signal-to-noise ratio maps are created for the filtered versions of
the signal map and the jack-knife map.

=back

The outcome (the match-filtered whitened signal map with suffix
C<_mf>) should be the optimal map with white noise properties. This is
the map to be used for science goals.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

Ideally there should be an even number of observations, but this is
not important if the number of input files is large.

=item *

A fuller description of the procedure may be found in the
documentation for the SCUBA-2 recipe
L<REDUCE_SCAN_FAINT_POINT_SOURCES_JACKKNIFE|REDUCE_SCAN_FAINT_POINT_SOURCES_JACKKNIFE>.

=item *

It is recommended that the PICARD recipe
L<SCUBA2_JACKKNIFE_PSF|SCUBA2_JACKKNIFE_PSF> be run to create a
suitable PSF to use for this recipe.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<JACKKNIFE_METHOD>

Method for creating jack-knife map. May be C<alternate> to use every
other file to create the two halves, or C<half> to use the first N/2
files (by date) for one half of the jack-knife and the remainder for
the other. Default is C<alternate>.

=item B<PSF_BOX>

Size of square region (in pixels) use to define effective PSF.

=item B<PSF_MATCHFILTER>

Name of a file to use as the map-filtered PSF.

=item B<STATS_COMP>

Name of component to use when determining the threshold level. Default
is C<texp> (the C<EXP_TIME> component).

=item B<STATS_ESTIMATOR>

Statistical estimator to use to determine threshold level. May be
C<max>, C<mean>, C<median>, or C<min>. Default is C<median>.

=item B<STATS_THRESH>

Threshold multiplier - the threshold will be this value multiplied by
the estimator. Default is 0.5 if using the exposure time, 1
otherwise.

=item B<WHITEN_BOX>

Size of the region used to calculate the angular power spectrum for
removing residual low-frequency noise in the data. Default is a square
region bounded by the noise being less than twice the minimum value.

=item B<WHITEN_ESTIMATOR>

Statistical estimator to determine the threshold level to define the
size of the whitening region. May be C<MIN>, C<MEAN> or
C<MEDIAN>. Default is C<MIN> (see B<WHITEN_BOX>).

=item B<WHITEN_THRESH>

The threshold multiplier at which to define the size of the whitening
region. Default is 2 (see B<WHITEN_BOX>).
