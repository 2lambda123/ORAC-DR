=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_JACKKNIFE - calculate optimal map using jack-knife noise estimator

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe uses a jack-knife method to remove residual low-spatial
frequency noise and create an optimal match-filtered output map. The
recipe proceeds as follows:

=over 2

=item *

The input images are coadded to produce a total signal map.

=item *

The observations are divided into two groups which are coadded
separately. These coadds are subtracted from one another to create the
C<jack-knife> map.

=item *

The angular power spectrum of the jack-knife map (which should consist
purely of noise) is calculated and used to remove residual low-spatial
frequency noise from the signal map and the given (map-filtered)
psf. This is the so-called C<whitening> step (because it produces a
map which has a noise power spectrum that is white).

=item *

The whitened signal map is processed with a matched filter using the
whitened psf image as the psf.

=item *

The jack-knife map is also whitened and processed with the matched
filter. This map should consist purely of noise.

=item *

Signal-to-noise ratio maps are created for the filtered versions of
the signal map and the jack-knife map.

=back

The outcome (the match-filtered whitened signal map) should be the
optimal map with white noise properties. This is the map to be used
for science goals.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

Ideally there should be an even number of observations, but this is
not important if the number of input files is large.

=head1 DISPLAY

None.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following recipe parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 2

=item FAKEMAP_SCALE

Amplitude of the fake source (in Jy) added to the timeseries to assess
the map-making response to a point source.

=item MAKEMAP_CONFIG

Name of a config file for use with the SMURF makemap task. The file
must exist in the current working directory, C<$MAKEMAP_CONFIG_DIR>,
C<$ORAC_DATA_OUT>, C<$ORAC_DATA_CAL> or C<$STARLINK_DIR/share/smurf>.

=item MAKEMAP_PIXSIZE

Pixel size in arcsec for the output map. Default is wavelength
dependent (4 arcsec at 850 um, 2 arcsec at 450 um).

=item PSF_MATCHFILTER

Name of a file to use as the map-filtered PSF.

=item WHITEN_BOX

Size of the region used to calculate the angular power spectrum for
removing residual low-frequency noise in the data. Default is a square
region bounded by the noise being less than twice the minimum value.
