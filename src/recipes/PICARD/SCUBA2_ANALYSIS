=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_ANALYSIS - Analyze SCUBA-2 images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple PICARD recipe to perform a few processing steps on SCUBA-2
images produced by SMURF makemap.

A background is fitted and removed, before FCFs are calculated (for
known calibrators). Finally the NEFD for each image is calculated.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The input data must be uncalibrated in order to calculate an FCF from
calibrator observations.

=item *

The results of the FCF and NEFD calculation are printed to the screen
and written to log files, C<log.fcf> and C<log.nefd>.
