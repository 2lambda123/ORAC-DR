=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_MAP_PSPEC - Calculate the noise power spectrum of a SCUBA-2 map

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculate the azimuthally-averaged spatial power spectrum of a SCUBA-2
map. The map is trimmed to a given size (rectangular or circular)
before having the source emission masked out. The power spectrum is
calculated and smoothed with a 5-pixel boxcar. The peak and half-power
points are determined and reported to the user in terms of angular
scale on the sky. Finally the mean power on various scales is
calculated and reported from the beamsize up to the length scale
defined by the filtering when the map was made.

=head1 NOTES

Creates a 1-dimensional output file for each input file with suffix
C<_pspec>.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<APERTURE_RADIUS>

Radius of aperture used to mask out a source at the map centre (if
B<MASK_METHOD> = C<aperture>). Default is 30 arcsec.

=item B<CROP_METHOD>

Method to use for trimming image. May be C<rectangle> or C<circle>.

=item B<MAP_HEIGHT>

Height of output map in arcsec.

=item B<MAP_RADIUS>

Radius of output map in arcsec (if C<CROP_METHOD>=C<circle>).

=item B<MAP_WIDTH>

Width of output map in arcsec.

=item B<MASK_METHOD>

Method for masking out source emission. May be C<aperture> or C<snr>
(default).

=item B<SNRCUT>

Signal-to-noise ratio cut to apply to mask out source emission (if
C<MASK_METHOD>=C<snr>). Default is 3 if not specified.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to indicate more information should be written to the
screen. Default is 0 (do not write extra).

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

None.
