=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_FLUXNOISE - Recipe for calculating fluxes and noise levels for SCUBA-2 images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple PICARD recipe to calculate source fluxes, FCFs and NEFDs

=head1 NOTES

The input data must be uncalibrated in order to calculate an FCF from
calibrator observations.

The results of the FCF and NEFD calculation are printed to the screen
and written to log files, C<log.fcf> and C<log.nefd>.

=head1 DISPLAY

No display is used by this recipe.
