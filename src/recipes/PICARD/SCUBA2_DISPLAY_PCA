=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_DISPLAY_PCA - Calculate and display properties of PCA components

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Apply PCA processing to raw SCUBA-2 data to determine dominant modes.

The input data should contain a fast-ramp flatfield (taken prior to
the target data).

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

Input files must contain raw SCUBA-2 data.

=item *

Input data should be from a single subarray only, and for a single
observation. However, no checks are made that this is actually the
case.

=item *

If results are to be calculated by the recipe, then all the input data
are used. This could lead to long run times with a large number of
files as the data are pre-processed with SMURF C<sc2clean>.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item LOGFILE

Flag to denote whether to write results to a log file at the end of
processing. Default is 1 (write a log file).

=item PCA_COMP

PCA components to analyze and display. Default is 0 to 5. The
components may be specified either as a comma-separated list
(e.g. 0,1,2,3 etc - they need not be contiguous or in order), or as a
Perl array slice (e.g. 0..3). The number of components must be no more
than 8. If more than 8 are given, only the first 8 are used.

=item PCA_KEEPFILES

Flag to indicate which files should be kept on disk. Default is 1
which keeps the PCA amplitude, component and power spectrum files on
disk. A value of 0 deletes all files, while a value of -1 indicates
that all files should be kept on disk.

=item PCA_REUSE

Flag to indicate that existing data should be used if present. Default
is 1 (reuse).

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

The results for each chosen PCA component are displayed in up to two
KAPVIEW windows. The left-hand column displays the amplitude scaled
between +/-2 sigma, the next column displays the component as a
function of time and the third column shows the power spectrum of each
component. Each KAPVIEW window can display results for up to 4 PCA
components.
