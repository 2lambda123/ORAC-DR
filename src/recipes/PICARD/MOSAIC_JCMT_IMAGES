=head1 NAME

MOSAIC_JCMT_IMAGES - Coadd images produced by JCMT instruments

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple PICARD recipe combine SCUBA-2 or ACSIS images taking into
account the EXP_TIME NDF component. Default behaviour is to combine
all images into a single coadd/mosaic. However this can be overridden
using the C<MOSAIC_EACH> recipe parameter which will combine images
based on the OBJECT in the FITS header.

Creates one or more output files with suffix C<_mos>, using the name
of the last file in the list as its base.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

When combining all given images (default behaviour), the user should
check that their positions do not differ by a C<large> amount. The
concept of large may depend on the input images (especially for 450 um
SCUBA-2 data) and how much they fill in the region between the extreme
positions.

=item *

Creating an image spanning 10-20 degrees will probably result in
images many GB in size unless the pixel scale is enlarged.

=item *

For SCUBA-2 images the C<WEIGHTS> and C<NEFD> NDF components are also
dealt with (if present).

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<MOSAIC_EACH>

Flag to indicate whether the data should be mosaicked by individual
object or combined into a single output file. Default is to create a
single output file.

=item B<MOSAIC_TASK>

The mosaicking task to use either C<wcsmosaic> (default) or
C<makemos>.

=item B<MAKEMOS_METHOD>

The image combination method for C<makemos>.

=item B<MAKEMOS_SIGMAS>

The sigma-clipping threshold if B<MAKEMOS_METHOD> is
C<SIGMAS>. Default is 4.

=item B<MASK_LOWVAR>

Flag to indicate that files should have pixels with anomalously-low
variances removed. Default is 0 (do not mask out low-variance pixels).

=item B<WCSMOSAIC_METHOD>

Rebinning method for C<wcsmosaic> and/or C<wcsalign>. Default is
C<nearest>.

=item B<WCSMOSAIC_PARAMS>

Additional parameters required for certain choices of B<WCSMOSAIC_METHOD>.

=head1 DISPLAY

None.
