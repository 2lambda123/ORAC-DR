=head1 NAME

CALIBRATE_SIDEBAND_RATIO - Apply sideband ratio corrections.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Apply a sideband ratio correction to an observation. This will
check the current sideband, and by default will apply the standard
JCMT sideband correction. It will first of all undo any previous
sideband correction applied that wrote its value into the SDBDCORR
FITS header. The output files have a suffix of C<_cal>.

Currently this only works for RxA3m observations.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following recipe parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<SIDEBAND>

The sideband to apply the correction for. If not given, the current
system sideband will be used.

=item B<SIDEBAND_CORR_FACTOR>

The correction factor to apply. The caller has to ensure that it is
valid for the LO_frequency in the provided fields, as no checking of
LO_frequency will be done when this option is used.

If this recpar is not given, the correction factor will be calculated from the
polynomials stored in the ACSIS-calibration system code.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

=over 2

=item *

Creates an output file for each calibrated input file with suffix
C<_cal>.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The SDBNCORR FITS header will be updated with the value used to calibrate
the data.

=head1 DISPLAY

None.
