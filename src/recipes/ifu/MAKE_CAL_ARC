MAKE_CAL_ARC

Reduces an IFU arc frame to the stage that it can be used to generate
an arc lines list.

=head1 Description

This recipe reduces a single IFU arc frame to a form that can be used
to generate an arc lines list file. These are static calibration files
stored in $ORAC_DATA_CAL/grisms/, which should rarely need to
be re-generated.  

Read-noise and Poisson variances are added to the frame and a bad
pixel mask is applied. The spectrum from each slice of the IFU is cut
out of the frame and pasted in a new frame in such a way that there
are no longer spaces between the spectra, the spectra are arranged in
the order in which they appear in the field of view and they are
approximately aligned in the dispersion direction. The spectrum is
flat-fielded.
