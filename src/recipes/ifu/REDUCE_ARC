MAKE_ARC -- Reduces an IFU arc spectrum

=head1 Description

This recipe takes an IFU arc spectrum. It performs bad pixel masking,
dark/bias subtraction, and flat-fielding.

The locations of the slices and the approximate shifts that should be 
applied to them are obtained from calibration files and written into the
header of the file by _LOCATE_SLICES_. These are used by _EXTRACT_SLICES_
to extract the slices and put them into another 2d image in the correct
order (the order in which they cover the 2d field of view) and 
approximately aligned in the spectral axis. 

The Figaro IARC task is used to obtain a wavelength calibration for each
row, which is filed with the calibration system for use by subsequent 
primitives. Finally all the rows are scrunched to a common, linear 
wavelength scale to allow the observer to check that the wavelength 
calibration was correct (ie that the spectra are now straight).
