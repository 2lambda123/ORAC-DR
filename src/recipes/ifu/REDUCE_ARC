REDUCE_ARC

Reduces an IFU arc spectrum

=head1 Description

This recipe is used to reduce an IFU arc spectrum. A wavelength
calibration is obtained for each row of the spectrum. The file
containing these calibrations is filed with the calibration system and
used to apply a common, linear wavelength calibration to all rows of
subsequent observations.

Read-noise and poisson variances are added to the frame and a bad
pixel mask is applied. The spectrum from each slice of the IFU is cut
out of the frame and pasted in a new frame in such a way that there
are no longer spaces between the spectra, the spectra are arranged in
the order in which they appear in the field of view and they are
approximately aligned in the dispersion direction. The spectrum is
divided by the flat-field.

The Figaro Iarc task is then used to obtain a wavelength calibration for
each row, using a pre-calibrated arc file to provide the initial
fit. Finally all the rows are scrunched to a common, linear wavelength
scale to allow the observer to check that the wavelength calibration
was correct (ie that the spectra are now straight).

=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

A flat field spectrum must have been reduced and filed as a calibration.
This is essential for locating the positions of the spectra.

=item *

The spectrum from each slice is smoothed with a 1 x 6 box filter
before wavelength calibration, primarily to cover bad pixels.

=item *

Variances are propagated, but are not used by Iarc when wavelength
calibrating.

=item *

The arc is wavelength calibrated using a list of arc lines from a
pre-calibrated arc spectrum to provide an initial fit. These are
expected to be constant and are in the $ORAC_DATA_CAL/grisms/
directory. The appropriate file (same grism and arc lamp) is provided 
by the calibration system.

=item *

The recipe checks the r.m.s.\ value of the wavelength fit returned by
Iarc, and will warn the user if this value seems too high. The
observer is recommended to always look at the scrunched arc frame. If
the wavelength calibration has worked successfully then all the arc
lines should be straight, and the frame should be virtually
indistinguishable from a long-slit spectrum.

=head1 Output data

A file giving the wavelength calibration to be applied to each row is
generated with a filename extension of .iar. 

A file containing the arc frame with all rows scrunched to a common
wavelength scale is produced with a suffix of _scr.
