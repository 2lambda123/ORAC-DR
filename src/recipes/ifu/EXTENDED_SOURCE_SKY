=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_SOURCE_SKY -- Extended source reduction using fewer sky
observations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces an extended source using UKIRT IFU data. The data
are taken in a SOOSOO... sequence, with any number of object frames
being observed between sky frames.

First, readnoise and Poisson variances are added to be propagated
through to the final result. The individual slices are extracted from
the image and recombined in a new image in the order in which they
appear on the sky, and are also approximately wavelength
calibrated. This image is flat-fielded, then sky-subtracted. A
previously-measured wavelength calibration is applied to produce a
common linear wavelength scale across the array.

The original frame is co-added into a group file, which is then
rearranged to form a data-cube.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item * A suitable flat-field, arc, and standard star must be
reduced and filed with the calibration system for this recipe to work.

=item * Variances are propagated if KAPPA 1.0 or later is used.
A warning is displayed if variances are lost, and the pipeline
will continue reduction.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The individual frames with slices extracted and approximately aligned
have the suffix _ext. The flat-fielded, scrunched, sky-subtracted
framess have the suffix _scr.

Several group files are created (with names starting gu). The coadded
scrunched 2-d spectrum has the suffix _scr. This is formed into a
datacube with the suffix _cub. A cube which has been divided by the
standard star spectrum is formmed with the suffix _dbsc and a flux
calibrated datacube with the suffix _fc.  A white light image is
extracted from this datacube with the suffix _im.
