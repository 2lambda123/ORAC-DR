=head1 NAME

POINT_SOURCE -- Point source reduction using optimal extraction 
for spectrum extraction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a faint source using UKIRT IFU data. The data
are taken in a standard object-sky configuration in either order.

First, readnoise and Poisson variances are added to be propagated
through to the final result. The individual slices are extracted
from the image and recombined in a new image in the order in which
they appear on the sky, and are also approximately wavelength
calibrated. This image is flat-fielded, then sky-subtracted. A
previously-measured wavelength calibration is applied to produce
a common linear wavelength scale across the array.

At this point a spectrum is optimally extracted.

The original frame is co-added into a group file, which is then
rearranged to form a data-cube.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item * A suitable flat-field, arc, and standard star must be
reduced and filed with the calibration system for this recipe to work.

=item * Object-sky pairs may be observed in any sequence. Any
observations with telescope offsets greater than 30 arcseconds
are assumed to be sky observations. Values given in the observation
type headers will take precedence when determining which observations
are on- and off-beam. In this case, on-beam observations will have
a header value of OBJECT and off-beam observations will have a
header value of SKY.

=item * Variances are propagated if KAPPA 1.0 or later is used.
A warning is displayed if variances are lost, and the pipeline
will continue reduction.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The individual frames with slices extracted and approximately aligned
have the suffix _ext. The flat-fielded, scrunched, sky-subtracted
pairs have the suffix _scr.

Several group files are created (with names starting gu_). The coadded
scrunched 2-d spectrum has the suffix _scr. This is formed into a
datacube with the suffix _cub. A cube which has been divided by the
standard star spectrum is formmed with the suffix _dbsc and a flux
calibrated datacube with the suffix _fc.  A white light image is
extracted from this datacube with the suffix _im.
