REDUCE_SINGLE_FRAME

Reduces a single IFU frame, producing a wavelength calibrated datacube

=head1 Description

This recipe reduces a single IFU frame (ie no sky subtraction or
coadding is carried out).

Read-noise and poisson variances are added to the frame and a bad
pixel mask is applied. The spectrum from each slice of the IFU is cut
out of the frame and pasted in a new frame in such a way that there
are no longer spaces between the spectra, the spectra are arranged in
the order in which they appear in the field of view and they are
approximately aligned in the dispersion direction. The spectrum is
flat-fielded and the wavelength calibration measured from the arc
spectrum is used to apply a common, linear wavelength scale to each
row of the the 2d spectrum.

Once all the rows of the image are scrunched to a common linear wavelength
scale the 2d spectrum from each slice is cut out and used to form
a single (y, lambda) plane of the (x, y, lambda) datacube.

=over 4

=item *

A suitable flat-field spectrum and arc spectrum should previously have
been reduced and filed with the calibration system.

=item *

Variances are propagated if Kappa 1.0 or later is available. A warning
is displayed if variances are lost.
