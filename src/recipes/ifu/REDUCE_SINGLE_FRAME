REDUCE_SINGLE_FRAME -- Reduces a single IFU frame, producing a datacube

=head1 Description

This recipe takes an IFU arc spectrum. It performs bad pixel masking,
dark/bias subtraction, and flat-fielding.

The locations of the slices and the approximate shifts that should be 
applied to them are obtained from calibration files and written into the
header of the file by _LOCATE_SLICES_. These are used by _EXTRACT_SLICES_
to extract the slices and put them into another 2d image in the correct
order (the order in which they cover the 2d field of view) and 
approximately aligned in the spectral axis. 

All the rows of the image are scrunched to a common linear wavelength 
scale. The 2d spectrum from each slice is then cut out and used to form
a single (y,lambda plane) of the (x, y, lambda) datacube.

The variance array should be propagated through the pipeline.
