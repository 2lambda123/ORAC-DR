=head1 Name

STANDARD_STAR_NOD_TO_SKY

Reduce IFU standard star observations with a separate sky position

=head1 Description

Take a series of standard star observations and extract and file a
standard star spectrum. This recipe is designed for use when an offset
sky position has been used. The frames are subtracted in pairs, giving
a sky subtracted spectrum, which is extracted using optimal
extraction. The resulting spectrum is divided by a black body spectrum
of the appropriate temperature and filed as a calibration frame.


=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

A suitable flat-field spectrum and arc spectrum should previously have
been reduced and filed with the calibration system.

=item *

Based on the spectroscopy recipe of the same name, and uses
spectroscopy primitives.

=item *

A datacube is formed of each subtracted pair and an image is extracted
to allow you to confirm that your target is suitably located on the
field, but no coadded datacube is formed.
