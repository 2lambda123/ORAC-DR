MEASURE_OFFSET -- Measures the offset of the slices on an IFU image compared to a given profile

=head1 Description

This recipe compresses an IFU image in the x-direction. This is then compared 
to the IFU profile stored in the calibration directory in order to measure the 
offset between the two. This number is required in the grism data files in the
calibration system for the reduction of IFU data.

The recipe should be run on an IFU spectrum of a uniformly illuminated source 
(pprobably one of the UIST continuum calibration sources). The offset measured
is that which maximises the total flux in the regions which are marked as being
within a slice

=item *

This recipe should only be necessary when new calibration files are required.
This will generally be when the slit wheel, grism wheel, camera wheel or 
array module has been removed and replaced.
