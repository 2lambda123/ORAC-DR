=head1 Name

STANDARD_STAR

Reduce IFU standard star observations with a separate sky position

=head1 Description

Take a series of standard star observations and extract and file a
standard star spectrum. This recipe is designed for use when an offset
sky position has been used. The frames are subtracted in pairs, giving
a sky subtracted spectrum, which is extracted using optimal
extraction. The spectral type and magnitude of the star is obtained
from the Simbad database.The resulting spectrum is divided by a black
body spectrum of the appropriate temperature and filed as a
calibration frame.


=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

A suitable flat-field spectrum and arc spectrum should previously have
been reduced and filed with the calibration system.

=item *

Sky-object pairs may be observed in any sequence (for example
sky-object-object-sky or object-sky-object-sky). Any observations
with telescope offsets greater than 30 arcsec will be assumed to be
a sky position. It is recommended that the observation types are set
to OBJECT and SKY as appropriate (this is essential if your offsets
to sky are smaller than 30 arcsec)

=item *

A datacube is formed of each subtracted pair and an image is extracted
to allow you to confirm that your target is suitably located on the
field, but no coadded datacube is formed.

=item *

Variances are propagated.

=item *

Based on the spectroscopy recipe of the same name, and uses
spectroscopy primitives.

A datacube is formed of each subtracted pair and an image is extracted
to allow you to confirm that your target is suitably located on the
field, but no coadded datacube is formed.

=head1 Output data

The standard star spectrum divided by a black body will be written to
a file with the name std_<n>_sp. A datacube in which every (x,y)
position contains this spectrum is created with the name std_<n>_cube.
