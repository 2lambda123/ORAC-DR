STANDARD_STAR 

Reduce IFU standard star observations 

=head1 Description

Produces a coadded, sky-subtracted datacube from a group of SKY-OBJECT
pairs of IFU frames. The spectrum of a standard star is extracted and
filed with the calibration system and its magnitude is looked up for
use in flux calibration.


=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

A suitable flat-field spectrum an arc spectrum should previously have
been reduced and filed with the calibration system.

=item *

Adapted from the spectroscopy recipe of the same name, and uses
spectroscopy primitives.
