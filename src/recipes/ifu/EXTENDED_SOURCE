EXTENDED_SOURCE

Produce a coadded, sky-subtracted, wavelength calibrated, flux
calibrated datacube from a group of SKY-OBJECT pairs of IFU frames.

=head1 Description

Read-noise and Poisson variances are added to the frame and a bad
pixel mask is applied. The spectrum from each slice of the IFU is cut
out of the frame and pasted in a new frame in such a way that there
are no longer spaces between the spectra, the spectra are arranged in
the order in which they appear in the field of view and they are
approximately aligned in the dispersion direction. The spectrum is
flat-fielded and sky-object pairs are now subtracted.  The wavelength
calibration previously measured from the arc spectrum is used to apply
a common, linear wavelength scale to each row of the the
sky-subtracted 2d spectrum. Sky-subtracted pairs are averaged, and
the resulting frame is coadded to the
group, which is then rearranged to form a data-cube. The spectral
dimension of the data-cube is divided by the standard star spectrum
and flux calibrated. Images can be extracted over a range of
wavelengths specified in a file called extract.images placed in
the $ORAC_DATA_OUT directory, and can be displayed by editing
the disp.dat file.

=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

A suitable flat-field spectrum, arc spectrum and standard star
spectrum should previously have been reduced and filed with the
calibration system.

=item *

Sky-object pairs may be observed in any sequence (for example
sky-object-object-sky or object-sky-object-sky). Any observations
with telescope offsets greater than 30 arcsec will be assumed to be
a sky position. It is recommended that the observation types are set
to OBJECT and SKY as appropriate (this is essential if your offsets
to sky are smaller than 30 arcsec)

=item *

Variances are propagated if Kappa 1.0 or later is available. A warning
is displayed if variances are lost.

=item *

A variant of this recipe, EXTENDED_SOURCE_NOSTD, is
available which does not divide the spectrum by a standard star or
flux calibrate the spectrum. It may be useful to specify this recipe
on the command line when running ORAC-DR if you choose to defer
observation of your standard until after you have observed your
object.

=head1 Output data

The individual frames with slices extracted and approximately aligned
have the suffix _ext. The flat-fielded, scrunched, sky-subtracted
pairs have the suffix _scr. Quad spectral images formed by summing
subsequent pairs have the suffix _quad. Cleaned spectral images
have the suffix _cln.

Several group files are created with names starting with "gu". The
coadded scrunched 2D spectral image has no suffix. This is formed
into a datacube with the suffix _cube. A white-light image is formed
from this datacube and has the suffix _im. The datacube is divided
by a standard star spectrum, and the resulting datacube has the
suffix _cube_dbs, which is then normalized to a one-second exposure
time, forming a cube with suffix _cube_nrm. This cube is then flux-
calibrated to form a cube with suffix _cube_fc. Another white-light
image is formed at this time, with suffix _im_fc. A spectrum is
created by collapsing the flux-calibrated datacube along the two
spatial axes, and the resulting spectrum has the suffix _sp_fc.
