=head1 Name

STANDARD_STAR_NOD_ON_IFU

Reduce IFU standard star observations when the star has been offset
within the field of the IFU.

=head1 Description

Take a series of standard star observations and extract and file a
standard star spectrum. This recipe is designed for use when the star
has been offset within the field of the IFU (similar to offsetting
along the slit in conventional spectroscopy). The frames are
subtracted in pairs, giving a positive and negative spectrum. The two
spectra are extracted using optimal extraction and averaged. The
resulting spectrum is divided by a black body spectrum of the
appropriate temperature and filed as a calibration frame.


=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

A suitable flat-field spectrum and arc spectrum should previously have
been reduced and filed with the calibration system.

=item *

Variances are propagated.

=item *

A datacube is formed of each subtracted pair and an image is extracted
to allow you to confirm that your target is suitably located on the
field, but no coadded datacube is formed.

=head1 Output data

The standard star spectrum divided by a black body will be written to
a file with the name std_<n>_sp. A datacube in which every (x,y)
position contains this spectrum is created with the name std_<n>_cube.
