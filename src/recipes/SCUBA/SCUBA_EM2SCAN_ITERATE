=head1 NAME

SCUBA_EM2SCAN_ITERATE - Emerson2 scan map reduction with iterative sky removal

=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the standard emerson2 reduction with an iterative sky
noise removal such that the sky model is recalculated after the
image is generated.

Will probably take a long time. This recipe is experimental and
may not work.
