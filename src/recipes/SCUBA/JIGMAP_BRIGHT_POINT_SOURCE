=head1 NAME

JIGMAP_BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE - Jiggle maps of bright point sources

=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe can be used to reduce bright point sources. Assumptions
are made for sky noise removal and the flux is calculated.

Additionally, this recipe assumes the point source is meant to appear
in the centre of the field. Each map in a group is adjusted so that
the centroid is placed at the centre.
