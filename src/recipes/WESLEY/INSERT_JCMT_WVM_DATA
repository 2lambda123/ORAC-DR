If the process is successful then the C<WVM_T12>, C<WVM_T42>, C<WVM_T78>

replaced with data from the C<.wvm> file.

=item JCMT_WVM_FILE

The file from which to read JCMT WVM data.  A full path should be given
if this is not in the output directory.

=item JCMT_WVM_DIR

If JCMT_WVM_FILE is not given, look for a WVM data file in this directory
named by the UT date, in the form "YYYYMMDD.wvm".  If not given, then
the appropriate UT date-based directory for the EAO file system is used.
