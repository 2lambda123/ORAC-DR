REDUCE_FTS_IMAGE_FOCUS - Recipe for processing FTS-2 image focus observations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a recipe for processing focus observations when FTS-2
is in the beam using the image port.

=head1 NOTES

This recipe is the same as the standard REDUCE_FOCUS recipe except
that it only handles timeseries data because it applies masking to
it, and it does not try to calibrate the data.

=head1 DISPLAY

None.
