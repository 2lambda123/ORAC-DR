=head1 NAME

REDUCE_DREAMSTARE - Process DREAM/STARE images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Input data from the individual subarrays are combined to produce a
single mosaic for each time step. Sky removal and extinction
correction take place on these images before they are combined into a
single Frame image.

The Frame image is calibrated and displayed, before being combined
with the Group image in a running average. The noise properties of the
new Group image are calculated and logged, and the image searched for
sources.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

This primitive can not handle time series data.

=item *

The current noise level is stored in C<log.noise>, the positions and
fluxes of any sources are stored in C<log.flux>.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.
