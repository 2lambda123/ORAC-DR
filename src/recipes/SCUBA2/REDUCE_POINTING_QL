=head1 NAME

REDUCE_POINTING_QL - Recipe for deriving pointing information with Quick Look

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe creates an image from a DREAM/STARE POINTING observation
with the data obtained in Quick-Look mode.

The images from the individual subarrays are combined, sky emission
removed (assuming a simple DC offset) and extinction is corrected
for. The image is calibrated and a C<.ok> flag file written to allow
the POINTING_FOCUS task at the summit to derive pointing offsets.

For additional record keeping, the source position is fitted and
offsets in Azimuth and Elevation from the nominal (0,0) position are
derived and logged. Note, however, that these may not be identical to
those derived by the POINTING_FOCUS task. Since the pointing will be
measured on a point source, the recipe also determines the beam size
and the flux conversion factor (FCF), which are also written to their
respective log files.

=head1 NOTES

The pointing offsets, beam size and FCF are written to the log files
C<log.pointing>, C<log.beam> and C<log.fcf>.

This recipe deals with the 2-D DA-processed images, not the time
series data.

The pointing offsets can be calculated from the centroid position or
from a fit to the source: see the C<METHOD> parameter for
_FIND_POINTING_OFFSETS_. The default is to determine the centroid.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is not displayed.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.

# For DREAM/STARE QL, the Frame consists of (up to) only 4 (related)
# files collected as DRAMA parameters so there is no need to collate
# related images. Therefore, make the Frame mosaic first so that
# subsequent primitives only have a single file to deal with. This
# results in a noticeable speedup. SCAN QL uses qlmakemap. Use a
# bilinear pixel-spreading scheme to maybe better define the peak
# position.
