REDUCE_POINTING_QL - Recipe for deriving pointing information with Quick Look

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe combines images from a pointing observation, removes sky
emission and corrects for extinction before calculating the offsets in
Azimuth and Elevation from the nominal (0,0) position. Since the
pointing will be measured on a point source, the recipe also determines
the beam size and the flux conversion factor (FCF).

The pointing offsets can be calculated from the centroid position or
from a fit to the source: see the C<METHOD> parameter for
C<_FIND_POINTING_OFFSETS_>. The default is to determine the centroid.

The pointing offsets, beam size and FCF are written to log files.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

This recipe is designed to operate in QUICK LOOK mode, and thus deals
with the 2-D DA-processed images, not the time series data.

# For QL, the Frame consists of (up to) only 4 (related) files
# collected as DRAMA parameters so there is no need to collate related
# images. Therefore, make the Frame mosaic first so that subsequent
# primitives only have a single file to deal with. This results in a
# noticeable speedup.
