REDUCE_SCAN - Recipe for processing SCAN data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the default recipe for processing SCAN data. Raw data are
passed to the iterative map maker which are processed to produce a
Frame image, which is then calibrated and displayed. A new Group image
is created and displayed. The noise properties of the new Group image
are calculated and written to a log file, C<log.noise>.

=head1 NOTES

The current noise level is stored in C<log.noise>.

The iterative map-maker (C<METHOD=ITER>) is the preferred imaging
tool, but it works best when all data from an observation as present
(including the bracketing dark frames).

For large amounts of data this recipe will spend a long time not
updating the ORAC-DR output. Check to see that C<makemap> is still
processing by running C<top> or C<ps>.

Configuration parameters for the iterative map-maker may be passed to
_MAKEMAP_FRAME_. Set C<MYCONFIG=1> for them to take effect. See the
SMURF C<makemap> documentation for details on the available config
parameters.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.
