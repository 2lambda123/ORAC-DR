REDUCE_SCAN - Recipe for processing SCAN data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a basic recipe for processing SCAN data. Raw data are passed
to the iterative map maker to produce a Frame image, which is then
calibrated and displayed. A new Group image is created and
displayed. The noise properties of the new Group image are calculated
and written to a log file, C<log.noise>.

=head1 NOTES

The current noise level is stored in C<log.noise>.

The iterative map-maker (C<METHOD=ITER>) is the preferred imaging
tool. Uncomment the relevant lines in this recipe if the rebinning
map-maker is to be used instead.

Configuration parameters for the iterative map-maker may be passed to
_MAKEMAP_FRAME_. Set C<MYCONFIG=1> for them to take effect. See the
SMURF C<makemap> documentation for details on the available config
parameters.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.
