BENCHMARK - Benchmarking recipe

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Simple but realistic recipe suitable for benchmarking tests. Processes
DREAM/STARE images. The quantity of data should always be the same so
as to obtain meaningful comparisons.

No images are displayed. This is purely a timing test for processing a
standard quantity of data.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

This recipe was originally written to process DREAM/STARE images but
has not been updated to handle time series data. Its use is not
recommended.
