=head1 NAME

REDUCE_NOISE_QL - QL processing NOISE observations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basic processing recipe suitable for NOISE observations in the
quick-look pipeline. Each subarray is handled separately. The noise
and NEP properties are calculated and displayed.

The outcome of this recipe is a noise image and bad-bolometer mask for
each subarray which is stored in the calibration system.

=head1 NOTES

This recipe only works with raw time-series data.

=head1 DISPLAY

The focal-plane noise map and corresponding histogram are displayed in
a Kapview window along with the focal-plane NEP map and the
percentage-change in the noise.
