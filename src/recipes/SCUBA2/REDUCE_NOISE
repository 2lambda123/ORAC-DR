=head1 NAME

REDUCE_NOISE - Basic recipe for reducing NOISE observations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basic processing recipe suitable for NOISE observations. The bolometer
power spectra are calculated and the relative power at two
(user-specifiable) frequencies is calculated. If this ratio exceeds a
critical value, defined by the MASKVAL parameter below, the bolometer
is marked as bad.

The outcome of this recipe is a noise image and bad-bolometer mask for
each subarray which is stored in the calibration system.

=head1 NOTES

This recipe only works with raw time-series data.

See the documentation for _CREATE_BAD_BOLO_MASK_ for further
parameters which may be specified to determine bad bolometers.

Bad-bolometer mask file names are stored in C<index.mask>.

=head1 DISPLAY

None.

# Standard introduction
_SCUBA2_HELLO_

# Calculate the noise - also creates NEP and noise ratio images
_CALCULATE_NOISE_

# Use the noise ratio image to define working bolometers and thence a
# bad bolometer mask (aka bad pixel mask)

# Display the noise images
_DISPLAY_NOISE_ CLIP=2,2

# Note that the last file created by the frame will not be deleted
# because it is never replaced by anything so will never get pushed
# onto the intermediates array. No reason to keep power spectra/FFT
# files so delete them too. Keep white noise images only.
