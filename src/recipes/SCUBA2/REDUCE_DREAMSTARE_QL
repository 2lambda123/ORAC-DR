=head1 NAME

REDUCE_DREAMSTARE_QL - QL processing DREAM/STARE images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The data are processed completely as they arrive (at 1 second
intervals): images from different subarrays are combined, a mean sky
level subtracted, then corrected for extinction and calibrated.

The calibrated Frame image is displayed. Creation of a new Group image
is deferred until a minimum number of Frame images have been created
to deal with any spikes in the Frame images. This number is set to 10
and may be changed: see the NMOS parameter for
_MAKE_MOSAIC_GROUP_DESPIKE_ below. The new Group image is displayed
and its noise properties are calculated and logged.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

This primitive can not handle time series data.

=item *

The number of images to combine into a new Group image is set by the
C<NMOS> parameter for _MAKE_MOSAIC_GROUP_DESPIKE_. Smaller numbers
will result in more frequent updates of the Group image at the expense
of de-spiking and good variance estimation.

=item *

The current noise level is stored in C<log.noise>, the positions and
fluxes of any sources are stored in C<log.flux>.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.

# Standard introduction
_SCUBA2_HELLO_

# For QL, the Frame consists of (up to) 4 (related) files collected as
# DRAMA parameters so there is no need to collate related
# images. Therefore, make the Frame mosaic first so that subsequent
# primitives only have a single file to deal with. This results in a
# noticeable speedup.
_MAKE_MOSAIC_FRAME_ MAKEMOS=0 GENVAR=0

# Remove sky, assume it's just a DC offset
_REMOVE_DC_SKY_ METHOD=MEAN VERBOSE=0

# Correct for extinction, using a single value across the entire image
_EXTINCTION_CORRECT_FRAME_ EXTCOR=QUICKER

# Calibrate data
_FIND_CALIBRATION_MAP_
_CALIBRATE_DATA_

# Display the frame mosaic in Gaia window 1
_DISPLAY_FRAME_

# Add the new frame mosaic into the group, but only create the Group
# mosaic once a suitable number of files exists to generate a reliable
# variance using the DESPIKE coadd mode
_MAKE_MOSAIC_GROUP_DESPIKE_ NMOS=10

# Determine the mean sky noise from the variance in the image. Store
# in log file log.noise.
_CALC_IMAGE_NOISE_ METHOD=VARIANCE GROUP=1

# Display the group mosaic in Gaia window 2 and its variance in window 3
_DISPLAY_GROUP_

# Delete excess Frame objects from the Group. In QL mode, there is one
# Frame object created per second which causes a significant increase
# in memory use and thus slowdown over time. Since the QL pipeline has
# no history requirements these Frame objects can be deleted safely.
_PURGE_FRAMES_

# Delete temporary files, keeping only calibrated data. Note that the
# last file created by the frame will not be deleted because it is
# never replaced by anything so will never get pushed onto the
# intermediates array
