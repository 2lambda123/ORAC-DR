=head1 NAME

REDUCE_FTS_ZPD - Recipe for processing FTS-2 ZPD calibration data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processes FTS-2 ZPD calibration data to estimate the location
of the ZPD (zero path difference) point.  The input data are split
into separate scans, baseline-subtracted and labeled with an approximate
moving mirror position coordinate system frame.  The position of the
peak fringe, corresponding to the ZPD position, is estimated for each scan
and then averaged for each subarray.  Finally, to ensure a smooth ZPD map
without gaps, a surface is fitted to the average ZPD positions.

=head1 NOTES

The FTS shutter status is normally read from the FTS_SH8D and FTS_SH8C
FITS headers.  If these are not defined (i.e. in older data) then an
attempt is made to read this information from the OCS configuration
XML (which of course indicates the I<requested> configuration).
