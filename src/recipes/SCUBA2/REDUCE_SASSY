=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SASSY - Process data for the SASSy project

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the recipe for processing data taken for the SCUBA-2
C<All-Sky> Survey (SASSy). The aim of SASSy is to map as much of the
sky at 850 um as possible, beginning with two strips: one along the
Galactic Plane, one perpendicular to the Plane, and passing through
the North Ecliptic Pole.

Raw data are passed to the map maker which are processed to produce a
Frame image, which is then calibrated and displayed. A new Group image
is created and displayed. The noise properties of the new Group image
are calculated and written to a log file, C<log.noise>.

The Group coadd has a matched-filter applied (with the aim of
highlighting point sources) and is passed to a source-finding
algorithm to pick out sources at or above the 5-sigma level. A
catalogue is written to disk.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The current noise level is stored in C<log.noise>.

=item *

For large amounts of data this recipe will spend a long time not
updating the ORAC-DR output. Check to see that C<makemap> is still
processing by running C<top> or C<ps>.

=item *

Alternative configuration parameters for the iterative map-maker may
be specified using the recipe parameters outlined below.

=item *

The output map is calibrated in units of mJy/beam.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 2

=item MAKEMAP_CONFIG

Name of a config file for use with the SMURF makemap task. The file
must exist in the current working directory, C<$MAKEMAP_CONFIG_DIR> or
C<$ORAC_DATA_OUT>.
