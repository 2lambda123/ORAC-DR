=head1 NAME

REDUCE_NOISE_PHOTON - determine photon noise contribution to total noise

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe derives the photon noise contribution by subtracting in
quadrature noise measurements made with the shutter open and
closed. The initial dark in the observation is used to estimate the
dark noise, and the same number of samples in the first on-sky data
are used to calculate the sky noise. The photon noise-equivalent-power
(NEP) is then given by

  NEP_ph = sqrt( NEP_sky**2 - NEP_dark**2 )

The image for each subarray is derived separately.

The results are written to a log file called C<log.photnoise>

=head1 NOTES

This recipe only works with raw time-series data and is designed to be
used in an offline mode.

=head1 DISPLAY

None.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 2

=item FLATSNR

Signal-to-noise ratio to use in the flatfield calculation.

=item NEP_CLIP

A comma-separated pair of numbers to indicate the low and high
clipping levels for the NEP. If only one is given, it is assigned to
the C<nepcliplow> parameter.

=item NOI_CLIP

A comma-separated pair of numbers to indicate the low and high
clipping levels for the noise. If only one is given, it is assigned to
the C<noicliplow> parameter.

=item NOISE_CFG

Name of an alternative config file used by C<calcnoise>. File must be
in ORAC_DATA_OUT.

=item RESIST_CFG

Name of an alternative list of resistor values used when calculating
the flatfield. File must be in ORAC_DATA_OUT.

=item NOISE_SAMPLES

Number of samples to use when calculating the noise properties of
on-sky data. Default is to use the same number as in the initial DARK.
