REDUCE_FTS_SCAN - Recipe for processing FTS-2 SCAN data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a basic recipe for processing FTS-2 SCAN data. All processing is done
via the FTS-2 applications in the SMURF package.

The input data are split into separate scans and then processed
to produce spectra.

=head1 NOTES

None.

=head1 DISPLAY

=over 4

=item kapview window 1 region 2
