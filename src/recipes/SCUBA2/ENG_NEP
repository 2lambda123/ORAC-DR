=head1 NAME

ENG_NEP - Process NEP measurements made in engineering mode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processes NOISE observations taken at various settings for
the pixel heater and detector bias. The noise properties are
calculated over a given frequency range and the resulting
noise-equivalent power (NEP) data for each subarray are combined into
a 4-d hypercube of the NEP as a function of bolometer position, heater
and detector bias value.

In addition the effective and weighted NEPs are calculated for each
subarray and heater/bias setting.

Details are written to log files: the noise properties are written to
C<log.bolonoise> as for regular noise observations, while the NEPs are
written to C<log.effnep> and C<log.wtnep>.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item NEP_MAX

Maximum NEP to be used in calculating the NEP images (W
Hz**-0.5). Default is 2.0e-14 W Hz**-0.5.

=item NEP_MIN

Minimum NEP to be used in calculating the NEP images (W
Hz**-0.5). Default is 2.0e-17 W Hz**-0.5.

=item NOISE_FREQRANGE

A pair of comma-separated values indicating the lower and upper
frequency bounds (in Hz) to be used in the calculation of the noise
properties. Default is 2,10 Hz.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

Not designed to run in real time.

=item *

Bias ramp data are ignored.
