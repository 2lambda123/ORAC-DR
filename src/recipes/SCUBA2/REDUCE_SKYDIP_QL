=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SKYDIP_QL - Process SKYDIP observations with the quick-look pipeline

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Quick-look pipeline recipe for processing skydip observations.

A skydip is a series of open-shutter noise measurements at different
elevations (airmasses). This recipe processes each noise measurement
and writes the results to log files. See L<REDUCE_NOISE|REDUCE_NOISE>
for further details.

=head1 NOTES

Since no specific skydip primitives exist, this recipe fills the time
by calculating the noise.

=head1 DISPLAY

Displays the current noise image(s).
