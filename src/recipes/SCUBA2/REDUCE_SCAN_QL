=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCAN_QL - QL process SCAN data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processes SCAN data from the quick-look pipeline. The
emphasis is on monitoring the noise performance of the instrument and
each file is treated as a noise observation.

=head1 NOTES

The bolometer noise properties are stored in C<log.bolonoise> and
C<index.noise>.

=head1 DISPLAY

The noise images for each subarray are displayed as a focal-plane
mosaic along with a histogram of the noise values.
