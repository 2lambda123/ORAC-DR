REDUCE_SCAN_QL - Recipe for processing SCAN data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processes SCAN data from the quick-look pipeline. Raw data
are passed to a simple rebinning map maker to produce a Frame image,
which is then calibrated and displayed. A new Group image is created
and displayed. The noise properties of the new Group image are
calculated and written to a log file, C<log.noise>.

=head1 NOTES

The current noise level is stored in C<log.noise>.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.
