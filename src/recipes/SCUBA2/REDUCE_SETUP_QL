=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SETUP_QL - process data from a setup observation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A setup observation consists of a fastramp flatfield followed by a
dark noise. This recipe is designed to process these data and will
write a flag file for the TCS to identify when to analyze the
flatfield and noise properties.

=head1 NOTES

This is the QL-specific version of the REDUCE_SETUP recipe.

=head1 DISPLAY

The flatfield solution and noise results are displayed in separate
Kapview windows
