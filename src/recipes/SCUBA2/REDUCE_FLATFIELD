=head1 NAME

REDUCE_FLATFIELD - Recipe for processing flatfield measurements

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processes data from a FLATFIELD observation and computes a
new flatfield solution for each subarray. A corresponding responsivity
map is created from this solution, and compared with the responsivity
map derived from the existing solution. The results are displayed
numerically and graphically (with each subarray in a separate window)
for user assessment.

The flatfield solution is kept on disk and stored in the calibration
system; all other files created are deleted.

=head1 NOTES

This recipe only works with raw time-series data.

Flatfield file names are stored in C<index.flat>.

=head1 DISPLAY

The results for each subarray are displayed in a separate Kapview
window.

The results displayed are:

=over 2

=item * 

Current responsivity solution (top left panel)

=item *

Previous responsivity solution, using same colour scale as the current
solution (top right panel)

=item *

Percentage change in responsivities (bottom right panel)

=item * 

Histograms of current and previous responsivities, displayed over the
same range (left and right bottom left panels respectively)

# Standard intro
_SCUBA2_HELLO_

# Calculate the flatfield solution. Also create responsivity images
# for analyzing the validity of the flatfield.
_CALCULATE_FLATFIELD_

# Analyze the flatfield solution (actually the responsivity) and store
# in calibration system if deemed good. Display a comparison with the
# previous responsivity.
_ANALYZE_FLATFIELD_

# Note that the last file created by the frame will not be
# deleted because it is never replaced by anything so will never
# get pushed onto the intermediates array
