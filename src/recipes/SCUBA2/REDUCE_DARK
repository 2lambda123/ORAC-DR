REDUCE_DARK - recipe for processing dark frames

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basic processing recipe suitable for dark frames. This recipe will
only be used if all of the input data are dark frames and the
observing mode is not one which only generates darks (e.g. FLATFIELD
or NOISE). To enable their use by subsequent tasks, the dark frames
are stored in the calibration system.

Intermediate files are deleted (if generated).

=head1 NOTES
