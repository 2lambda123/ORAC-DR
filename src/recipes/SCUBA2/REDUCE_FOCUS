=head1 NAME

REDUCE_FOCUS - Recipe for deriving focus information

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe combines images from a DREAM/STARE FOCUS observation,
removes sky emission and corrects for extinction. When enough data
exist - defined as the existence of a minimum number of images for the
last of the expected focus positions - the images for each focus
position are combined and a data cube is created with SMU offset in mm
as the third axis.

Once the cube has been created, a C<.ok> flag file is written to
indicate to the online POINTING_FOCUS task that processing is
complete. For its own record keeping, the recipe also makes its own
estimate of the best-fit focus position which is written to a log
file, C<log.focus>.

=head1 NOTES

The best-fit focus position is written to C<log.focus>.

This recipe deals with the 2-D DA-processed images, not the time
series data.

The C<minimum number of images> referred to above is defined as the
mean number of images obtained for each of the preceding focus
positions. The recipe will fail to produce a cube if the pipeline does
not receive enough data, even once the observation has ended. This is
because the OBSEND flag in the FITS header will only be true for the
final dark frame and thus the pipeline will never see it.

No data are displayed until the cube of focus images has been created.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is not displayed.

The Group data are displayed in a Kapview window with the image at
each focus pisition displayed in a separate panel.
