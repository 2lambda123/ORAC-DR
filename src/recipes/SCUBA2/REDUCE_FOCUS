REDUCE_FOCUS - Recipe for deriving focus information

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe combines images from a FOCUS observation, removes sky
emission and corrects for extinction. When enough data exist - defined
as the existence of a minimum number of images for the last of the
expected focus positions - the images for each focus position are
combined and a data cube is created with SMU offset in mm as the third
axis.

Once the cube has been created, a flag file is written to indicate to
the telescope POINTING_FOCUS task that processing is complete. The
recipe also makes its own estimate of the best-fit focus position by
fitting a parabola to the fitted peak flux densities at each SMU
position. The solution is written to a log file, C<log.focus>.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The best-fit focus position is written to C<log.focus>.

=item *

The C<minimum number of images> referred to above is defined as the
mean number of images obtained for each of the preceding focus
positions. The recipe may fail to produce a cube if the pipeline does
not receive enough data, even once the observation has ended. This is
because the OBSEND flag in the FITS header will only be true for the
final frame and thus the QL/summit pipelines may not see it.

=item *

No data are displayed until the cube of focus images has been created.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is not displayed.

The Group data are displayed in a Kapview window with the image at
each focus pisition displayed in a separate panel.
