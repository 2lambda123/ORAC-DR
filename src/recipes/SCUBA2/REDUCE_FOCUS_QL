=head1 NAME

REDUCE_FOCUS_QL - process focus observations in the quick-look pipeline

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processes data for FOCUS observations, creating images for
each SMU position. When enough data exist - defined as the existence
of a minimum number of images for the last of the expected focus
positions - the images for each focus position are combined and a data
cube is created with SMU offset in mm as the third axis.

Once the cube has been created, a flag file is written to indicate to
the telescope POINTING_FOCUS task that processing is complete. The
recipe also makes its own estimate of the best-fit focus position by
fitting a parabola to the fitted peak flux densities at each SMU
position. The solution is written to a log file, C<log.focus>.

This primitive is largely the same as L<REDUCE_FOCUS|REDUCE_FOCUS>
with minor modifications to handle data as they are taken.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The best-fit focus position is written to C<log.focus>.

=item *

The C<minimum number of images> referred to above is defined as the
mean number of images obtained for each of the preceding focus
positions. The recipe may fail to produce a cube if the pipeline does
not receive enough data, even once the observation has ended. This is
because the OBSEND flag in the FITS header will only be true for the
final subscan and thus the QL pipeline may not see it.

=item *

No data are displayed until the cube of focus images has been created.

=item *

The C<bright_compact> config file is used.

=item *

See also L<REDUCE_FOCUS|REDUCE_FOCUS>.

position displayed in a separate panel.
