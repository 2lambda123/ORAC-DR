=head1 NAME

ASSESS_DATA_NOISE - Calculate noise properties of SCUBA-2 data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is designed to provide observers with a simple assessment
of the noise properties of their data. It does this by calculating the
noise for either the first on-sky data file (default) or for the
entire time stream. The results are passed through the same quality
assurance (QA) checks as performed by the quick-look (QL) pipeline
running at the telescope.

The processing is controlled by the recipe parameters described below.

=head1 NOTES

None.

=head1 DISPLAY

The focal-plane mosaic for the noise and NEP are displayed, scaled
between 0 and the relevant spec defined by the quality assurance
parameters. A histogram of noise values is also plotted, with the same
upper bound.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following recipe parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 2

=item NOISE_CALC

Type of noise calculation to perform. May be C<full>, which calculates
the noise properties of the entire time stream or C<quick> to use only
the first on-sky subscan (30 seconds).

=item NOISE_CFG

The name of a config file to use when calculating the noise
properties. The default is to use the standard noise config but the
user is advised to supply the same config used in the map-making
process.

=item NOISE_FREQLO

The frequency at which to calculate the low-frequency noise. Default
is 0.5 Hz.

=item NOISE_FREQRANGE

A pair of numbers indicating the frequency range (in Hz) over which the
noise is to be calculated. Default is 2,10.
