REDUCE_SCAN_SUMMIT - Summit recipe for processing SCAN data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a basic recipe for processing SCAN data with the iterative
map-maker in the summit pipeline. This recipe makes use of a
percentage completion parameter which delays the map-making step until
a certain proportion of the data exist on disk.

Flatfielded data are passed to the iterative map maker to produce a
Frame image, which is then calibrated and displayed. A new Group image
is created and displayed. The noise properties of the new Group image
are calculated and written to a log file, C<log.noise>.

=head1 NOTES

The current noise level is stored in C<log.noise>.

The C<REBIN> method is not recommended.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1 (though nothing will
show until the percentage completion criteria are satisfied).

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.
