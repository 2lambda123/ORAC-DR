=head1 NAME

ENG_NEP - Recipe for processing engineering data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe calculates the effective noise-equivalent power (NEP) for
each subarray for a range of pixel heater and bias values. The results
are written as an image with heater values along the x-axis and bias
values along the y-axis.

=head1 NOTES

Bias ramps are ignored.

=head1 DISPLAY

Each image is displayed in a single KAPVIEW window.
