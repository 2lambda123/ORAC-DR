# Name:
#    REDUCE_ARC
#
# Purpose:
#    Reduces arc-lamp observations.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Reduces an arc-lamp observation in the conventional manner, and
#    applies an estimated wavelength scale (based on the header
#    information) so that you can easily refer to an arc-line list or
#    map to check that you are hitting your wavelength region of interest.
#    It also sums arcs taken through the same grating, filter, and
#    resolution.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for ESO infra-red spectrometers.
#    -  Currently, this recipe does not attempt to use the arc-lamp data to
#    carry out proper wavelength calibration.  This will change at some
#    point in the future.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Frames called arc_<group_number>_<grating_name>_<filter>_<slit_name>
#    one for each grating name, filter and slit name comination present in
#    the group.

Reduces an arc-lamp observation in the conventional manner, and
applies an estimated wavelength scale (based on the header
information) so that you can easily refer to an arc-line list or
map to check that you are hitting your wavelength region of interest.
It also sums arcs taken through the same grating, filter, and
resolution.
