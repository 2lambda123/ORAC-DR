=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_SOURCE_NOSTD -- EXTENDED_SOURCE without using a standard star.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See the documentation for the EXTENDED_SOURCE recipe. This version is
identical except that it does not attempt to use a standard star and
thus processing stops after forming the group image.

If you aquire suitable standard star observations later in the night,
you should reduce them first, then re-process your target data with
the EXTENDED_SOURCE recipe.

Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving and
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
inbetween.
