# Name:
#    NIGHT_LOG

# Purpose:
#    Produces a text file log of a night's spectroscopy observations.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe takes a night's spectroscopy observations, and creates a
#    text file containing a headed tabulation of parameters for each frame. 
#
#    The parameters are: observation number, the group number, whether
#    or not the data were good, the object name, whether or not the
#    observation is a of standard, observation type, the slit name and
#    angle, the telescope offsets, UT start time, start airmass, exposure
#    time, number of coadds, filter, grating name, grating order,
#    wavelength, and data-reduction recipe name.
# 
# Notes:
#    -  Run with "oracdr -noeng -from 1 -skip"  for efficiency.
#    -  The <date> comes from the internal header ORAC_UTDATE.

# Output Data:
#    -  The text log file $ORAC_DATA_IN/<date>.nightlog, where
#    <date> is the UT date.  This file should be 132 or fewer
#    columns wide.

NIGHT_LOG -- Produces a text file log of a night's spectroscopy observations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe takes a night's spectroscopy observations, and creates a
text file containing a headed tabulation of parameters for each frame.

The parameters are: observation number, the group number, whether
or not the data were good, the object name, whether or not the
observation is a of standard, observation type, the slit name and
angle, the telescope offsets, UT start time, start airmass, exposure
time, number of coadds, filter, grating name, grating order,
wavelength, and data-reduction recipe name.

=head1 NOTES

Run with "oracdr -noeng -from 1 -skip"  for efficiency.

=item *

The E<lt>dateE<gt> comes from the internal header ORAC_UTDATE.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The text log file F<$ORAC_DATA_IN/E<lt>dateE<lt>.nightlog>, where
E<lt>dateE<gt> is the UT date.  This file should be 132 or fewer
columns wide.
