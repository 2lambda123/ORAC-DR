=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_SOURCE_NOFLAT - EXTENDED_SOURCE without flat-fielding

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See the documentation for the EXTENDED_SOURCE recipe. This version is
identical except that it does not attempt to flat-field the data.

If you acquire suitable flat fields later in the night, you should
reduce them first, then re-process your target data with the
EXTENDED_SOURCE recipe.

Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving and
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
inbetween.
