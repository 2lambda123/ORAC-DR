=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_SOURCE_NOFLAT - For reducing extended source observations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A spectroscopy recipe for observations of Extended Sources
Assumes that the data are taken in a pair-wise manner.

This recipe is suitable for all extended source data taken in a pair-wise
manner, including nodding along the slit, nodding to sky, and
chop-mode observations.

The final product of this recipe is a sky subtracted image spectrum of
the target, with an approximate wavlength and flux scale
applied. Processing includes division by a
standard star.

For details of the data reduction process used, see the documentation
for the individual primitives.

This recipe does not attempt to flat field the data.
