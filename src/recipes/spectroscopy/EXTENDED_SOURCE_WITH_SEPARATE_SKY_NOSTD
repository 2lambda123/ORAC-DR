=head1 DESCIPTION

For use when you want to take several on-target OBJECT frames
for each off-target SKY frame. It is only sensible to use this 
recipe when working with low, stable sky counts, and with extended
targets where you cannot nod along the slit.

Before the pipeline sees an OBJECT frame with this recipe, you must
have had it reduce a suitable SKY frame with the REDUCE_SKY recipe, otherwise
the pipeline cannot continue. Thus you should use a sequence like:

SKY
OBJECT
OBJECT

rather than

OBJECT
SKY
OBJECT

This variant does not attempt to use a standard star.
