=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY_NOSTD - EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY without
division by a standard star.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See the documentation for the EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY
recipe. This version is identical except that it does not attempt to
use a standard star, and thus processing stops after forming the group
image.

If you acquire suitable standard star observations later in the night,
you should reduce them first, then re-process your target data with
the EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY recipe.

Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
in between.
