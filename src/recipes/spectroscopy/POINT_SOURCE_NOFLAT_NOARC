=head1 NAME

POINT_SOURCE_NOFLAT - POINT_SOURCE but without flat-fielding or arc
spectrum extraction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See the POINT_SOURCE recipe documentation. This version is identical except
that it does not attempt to flat field the data or extract a spectrum from
an arc at the same position as the detected beam.

If you acquire suitable flat fields later in the night, you should
reduce them first, then re-process your target data with the
POINT_SOURCE recipe.

Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
in between.
