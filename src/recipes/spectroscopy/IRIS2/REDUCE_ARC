=head1 NAME

REDUCE_ARC - Reduces an arc lamp observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reduces an arc lamp observation in the conventional manner, and
applies an estimated wavelength scale (based on the IRIS2 grism
and blocking filter) so that you can easily refer to an arc line
list or map to check that you are hitting your wavelength region
of interest.

=head1 NOTE

Currently, this recipe does not attempt to use the arc lamp data to
carry out proper wavelength calibration. This will change at some
point in the future.
