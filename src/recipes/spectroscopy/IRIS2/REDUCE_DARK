=head1 NAME

REDUCE_DARK - Reduce a dark frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reduces a Dark frame. This is generally only used by the array test
recipe and for engineering. It is unusual to require a dark frame with
CGS4 as the dark frame would be the same in the offset beam or sky
image and thus cancels when sky subtraction is carried out. With IRIS2
however, the K-band flatfield may have a non-negligible thermal background,
e.g. lights on in the dome.

# SDR: Currently dark will be selected on basis of exposure time
# and ORAC_TIME. Strictly speaking, the read mode, speed, and exposure
# parameters (Period, Nreads, Cycles) should be matched also, but
# usually these will correspond to the closest dark frame in ORAC_TIME
# anyway.
