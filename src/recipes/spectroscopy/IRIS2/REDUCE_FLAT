=head1 NAME

REDUCE_FLAT - Reduces a spectroscopy flat field.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reduces a flat field in the conventional manner, including
normalisation by a model of the blackbody source. Files the normalised
flat field frame for use by subsequent flat fielding operations.

=head1 NOTES

Normalising by a black body probably isn't optimal for sky-flats,
especially if they contain strong lines.
