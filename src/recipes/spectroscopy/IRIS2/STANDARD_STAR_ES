=head1 NAME

STANDARD_STAR_ES - Reduce a standard star observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a standard star observation, assuming that it is
observed in a conventional nod-along-slit manner. It extracts the
spectrum of the standard, acquires details of the star (either from a
locally held list or from SIMBAD), and files it such that it can be
later used to create divided by standard and flux calibrated spectra
of targets that are observed. This recipe assumes the standard star
has been nodded between rows 185 and 670 of IRIS2's array (rather than
the conventional rows 580 and 640), when the target is an extended source.
