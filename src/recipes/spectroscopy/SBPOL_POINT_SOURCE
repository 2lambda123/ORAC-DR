=head1 NAME

SBPOL_POINT_SOURCE - Single-beam polarimetry of a point source.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Performs reduction of single-beam polarimetry of a point source.
This recipe is essentially the same as POINT_SOURCE, but works on
data taken for single-beam polarimetry, and creates a Stokes cube
and polarization data as a final step.
