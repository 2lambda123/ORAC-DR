=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY_NOFLAT_NOSTD - EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY without flats or stds.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See the documentation for the EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY
recipe. This version is identical except that it does not attempt to
flat field the data or use a standard star, and thus processing stops
after forming the group image.

If you acquire suitable flat fields and standard star observations
later in the night, you should reduce them first, then re-process your
target data with the EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY recipe.

Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving and
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
inbetween.
