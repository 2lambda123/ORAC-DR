=head1 NAME

POINT_SOURCE_NOSTD - For reducing point source observations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A spectroscopy recipe for observations of Point Sources
Assumes that the data are taken in a pair-wise manner.

This recipe is suitable for all point source data taken in a pair-wise
manner, including nodding along the slit, nodding to sky, and
chop-mode observations.

The final product of this recipe is an spectrum of the target, with an
approximate wavlength and flux scale applied. Processing includes
optimal extraction and division by a standard star.

For details of the data reduction process used, see the documentation
for the individual primitives.

This _NOSTD variant does not attempt to use a standard star
