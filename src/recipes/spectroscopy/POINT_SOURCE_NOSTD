=head1 NAME

POINT_SOURCE_NOSTD -- as POINT_SOURCE but without using a standard star

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See the POINT_SOURCE recipe documentation. This version is identical
except that it does not use a standard star, and thus processing stops
after extraction of the spectrum from the group frame.

If you aquire suitable standard star observations later in the night,
you should reduce them first, then re-process your target data with
the POINT_SOURCE recipe.

Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving and
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
inbetween.
