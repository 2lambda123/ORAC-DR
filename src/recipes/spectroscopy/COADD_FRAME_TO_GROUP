=head1 DESCIPTION

The default 'nod to blank sky' recipe. Use for extended sources.
Requires you to have allready taken a flat field and a standard star.

Reduceds the data, estimating the wavelength calibration, optimally
extracts the spectrum and uses the previously observed standard star
for flux calibration.

=head1 NOTE

When using this recipe, you must have a sequence that takes a SKY
frame *BEFORE* it takes the first object frame; otherwise, the
pipeline will fail as it will be unable to reduce the first object
frame as it won't be able to sky subtract. I suggest using the sequence
SKY-OBJECT-OBJECT-SKY rather then the normal OBJECT-SKY-SKY-OBJECT.
