=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY_NOFLAT -- EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY without flat-fielding.

=head1 DESCIPTION

See the documentation for the EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY
recipe. This version is identical except that it does not attempt to
flat-field the data.

If you aquire suitable flat fields later in the night, you should
reduce them first, then re-process your target data with the
EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY recipe.

Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving and
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
inbetween.
