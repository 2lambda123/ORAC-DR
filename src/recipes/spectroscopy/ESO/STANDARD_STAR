=head1 NAME

STANDARD_STAR - Reduce a standard star observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a standard star observation, assuming that it is
observed in a conventional nod-along-slit manner. It extracts the
spectrum of the standard, acquires details of the star (either from a
locally held list or from SIMBAD), and files it such that it can be
later used to create divided by standard and flux calibrated spectra
of targets that are observed.
