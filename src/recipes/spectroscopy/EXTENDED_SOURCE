=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_SOURCE - For reducing extended source observations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A spectroscopy recipe for observations of extended sources.
Assumes that the data are taken in a pair-wise manner.

This recipe is suitable for all extended source data taken in a pair-wise
manner, including nodding along the slit, nodding to sky, and
chop-mode observations.

The final product of this recipe is a sky subtracted image spectrum of
the target, with an approximate wavelength and flux scale
applied. Processing includes division by a standard star.

For details of the data reduction process used, see the documentation
for the individual primitives.
