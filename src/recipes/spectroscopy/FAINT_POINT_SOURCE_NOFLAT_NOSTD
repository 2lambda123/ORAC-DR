=head1 NAME

FAINT_POINT_SOURCE_NOFLAT_NOSTD - FAINT_POINT_SOURCE minus flats and standards

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See the FAINT_POINT_SOURCE recipe documentation. This version is
identical except that it does not flat field the data or use a
standard star, and thus processing stops after extraction of the
spectrum from the group frame.

If you acquire suitable flat field and standard star observations
later in the night, you should reduce them first, then re-process your
target data with the FAINT_POINT_SOURCE recipe.

Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving and
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
inbetween.
