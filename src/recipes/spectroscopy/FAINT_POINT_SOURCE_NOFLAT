=head1 NAME

FAINT_POINT_SOURCE_NOFLAT - As FAINT_POINT_SOURCE but without flat fielding

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See the FAINT_POINT_SOURCE recipe documentation. This version is
identical except that it does not attempt to flat field the data.

If you acquire suitable flat fields later in the night, you should
reduce them first, then re-process your target data with the
FAINT_POINT_SOURCE recipe.

Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving and
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
inbetween.
