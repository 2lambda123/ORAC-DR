=head1 NAME

POINT_SOURCE - For reducing point source observations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A spectroscopy recipe for observations of point sources.
Assumes that the data are taken in a pair-wise manner.

This recipe is suitable for all point source data taken in a pair-wise
manner, including nodding along the slit, nodding to sky, and
chop-mode observations.

The final product of this recipe is an spectrum of the target, with an
approximate wavelength and flux scale applied. Processing includes
optimal extraction and division by a standard star.

This recipe does not require an arc spectrum to complete reduction.
As such, its use is not recommended for on-line data reduction as
there will be no warning if a suitable arc has not been taken.

For details of the data reduction process used, see the documentation
for the individual primitives.

This variant does not require or use an arc-lamp observation.
