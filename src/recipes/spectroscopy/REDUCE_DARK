=head1 NAME

REDUCE_DARK - Reduce a dark frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reduces a Dark frame. This is generally only used by the array test
recipe and for engineering. It is unusual to require a dark frame with CGS4 as
the dark frame would be the same in the offset beam or sky image and
thus cancels when sky subtraction is carried out.
