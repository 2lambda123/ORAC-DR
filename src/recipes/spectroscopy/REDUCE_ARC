=head1 DESCIPTION

Reduces an arc lamp observation in the conventional manner, and
applies an estimated wavelength scale (based on the CGS4 motor
positions) so that you can easily refer to an arc line list or map to
check that you are hitting your wavelength region of interest.

=head 1 NOTE

Currently, this recipe does not attempt to use the arc lamp data to
carry out proper wavelength calibration.
