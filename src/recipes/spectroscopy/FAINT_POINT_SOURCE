=head1 NAME

FAINT_POINT_SOURCE - For reducing faint point source observations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A spectroscopy recipe for observations of point sources.
Assumes that the data are taken in a pair-wise manner.

This recipe is suitable for all point source data taken in a pair-wise
manner, including nodding along the slit, nodding to sky, and
chop-mode observations.

The final product of this recipe is an spectrum of the target, with an
approximate wavelength and flux scale applied. Processing includes
optimal extraction and division by a standard star.

For details of the data reduction process used, see the documentation
for the individual primitives.

The optimal extraction windows used to extract spectra from the group
image are centred on the rows determined for the standard star.
