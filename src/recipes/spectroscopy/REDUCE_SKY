REDUCE_SKY - Reduces a sky frame

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reduces a blank sky observation, and files it with the calibration
system for use in subsequent data reduction. Note that in pair-wise
observing proceedures, you should generally not be taking SKY frames -
both beam positions are classified as OBJECT frames, and should be
handled by whatever pair-wise recipe is being used for the main-beam
frames.
