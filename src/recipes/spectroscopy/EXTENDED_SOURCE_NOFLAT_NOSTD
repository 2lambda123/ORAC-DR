=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_SOURCE_NOFLAT_NOSTD - EXTENDED_SOURCE without flat-fields or std stars.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See the documentation for the EXTENDED_SOURCE recipe. This version is
identical except that it does not attempt to flat-field the data or
use a standard star and thus processing stops after forming the group
image.

If you acquire suitable flat-field and standard star observations later
in the night, you should reduce them first, then re-process your
target data with the EXTENDED_SOURCE recipe.

Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving and
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
inbetween.
