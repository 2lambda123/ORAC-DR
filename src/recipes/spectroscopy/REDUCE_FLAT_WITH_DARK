=head1 NAME

REDUCE_FLAT_WITH_DARK - Reduces a spectroscopy flat field with dark
subtraction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reduces a flat field, including dark subtraction and normalisation by
a model of the blackbody source. Files the normalised flat field frame
for use by subsequent flat fielding operations.

=head1 NOTES

Normalising by a black body probably isn't optimal for sky-flats,
especially if they contain strong lines.

This recipe will need updating if Michelle is to use sky flats.
