=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_SOURCE_WITH_SEPARATE_SKY - For extended source on stable sky background.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For use when you want to take several on-target OBJECT frames for each
off-target SKY frame. It is only sensible to use this recipe when
working with low, stable sky counts, and with extended targets where
you cannot nod along the slit. Currently, this can only really be
considered to apply to certain observations using the CGS4 echelle
grating.

Before the pipeline sees an OBJECT frame with this recipe, you must
have had it reduce a suitable SKY frame with the REDUCE_SKY recipe,
otherwise the pipeline cannot continue. Thus you should use a sequence
like "SKY, OBJECT, OBJECT" rather than "OBJECT, SKY, OBJECT". In each
set of observations you can follow the SKY frame with as many OBJECT
frames as you like. There is obviously a trade-off in that the more
OBJECT frames you do, the more time you spend observing your target
rather than the sky, but also the longer the interval between SKY
frames, and thus the more liable you are to be affected by sky
variation.
