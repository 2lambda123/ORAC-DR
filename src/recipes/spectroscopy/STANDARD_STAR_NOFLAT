STANDARD_STAR_NOFLAT - reduce a standard star without flat fielding

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a standard star observation, assuming that it is
observed in a conventional nod-along-slit manner. It extracts the
spectrum of the standard, acquires details of the star (either from a
locally held list, or from SIMBAD), and files it such that it can be
later used to create divided by standard and flux calibrated spectra
of targets that are observed.

This recipe does not attempt to flat-field the frames.
