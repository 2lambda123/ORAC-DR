=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SINGLE_FRAME_BASIC - reduces a frame of data without using a flat or bias

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Carries out all the processing we do on science data, up to the point
where it gets added into a group and group processing commences. This
variant does not attempt to flat-field the data, or de-bias the data. The 
latter results in you not getting a variance array with STARE or CHOP data.
