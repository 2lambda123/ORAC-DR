=head1 DESCIPTION

Reduces a Spectroscopy BIAS observation, including coadding multiple
integrations. Files the reduced bias frame for use by subsequent
reduction of STARE mode data.

=head1 NOTES

Creates a variance array for the bias frame, determined from the 
variance of the mltiple integrations in the bias observation. There
should be at least 3 integrations in a BIAS observation.

#_MASK_BAD_PIXELS_SPECT_
# The bpm is incomplete at this point anyway most likely.

#_INTERLEAVE_DETECTOR_POSITIONS_
# Shouldn't be multiple detector positions.

#_COADD_MULTIPLE_EXPOSURES_
# No, we'll handle this in a specific primitive.
