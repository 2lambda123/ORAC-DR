parameters:

=over 4

=item XMIN

Only data points whose X co-ordinate is larger than this value are used to generate statistics information

=item XMAX

Only data points whose X co-ordinate is smaller than this value are used to generate statistics information

=item YMIN

Only data points whose Y co-ordinate is larger than this value are used to generate statistics information
