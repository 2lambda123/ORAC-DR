# Name:
#    TEST_WFCAM_CIRSI

# Purpose:
#    Test pipeline for dummy WFCAM data.  

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe does a reduction for dummy WFCAM frames.  These consist
#    of WFCAM frame headers with CIRSI images appended. At the moment the
#    recipe does a flat field correction, sky subtraction, reset anomaly
#    removal, rough WCS assignment, dither and WCS fit.  More stuff to be
#    added at a later date
#
# Notes:
#    -  This is not intended to be a first pass WFCAM pipeline and only is
#       intended for a particular dataset.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Instrumental signature removed images and dithers. All have at
#       at least a first pass WCS.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    none

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.

# References:
#    none

TEST_WFCAM_CIRSI

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe flat fields, sky subtracts, reset anomaly corrects, dithers and
fits a WCS to dummy WFCAM data. It expects a flat field image to be present.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This is B<not> a first pass WFCAM pipeline.  It's intended only for use in
defining some of the WFCAM class files and for testing an installation 
of CIRDR. If you want to use this, you'll need to get the test dataset.
