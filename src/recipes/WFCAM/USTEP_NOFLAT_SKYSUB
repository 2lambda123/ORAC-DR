# Name:
#    USTEP_NOFLAT_SKYSUB
 
# Purpose:
#    Dark correct a microstep sequence (no flat fielding). Subtract a sky
#    estimate derived from the frames themselves. Interleave and do an
#    astrometric and photometric calibration on the derived catalogue.
 
# Language:
#    Perl5
 
# Description:
#    This recipe does the following to a microstep sequence:
#       - Dark correction using a pre-existing master frame
#       - Forms a mean sky frame from the images and subtracts it
#       - Interleaving
#       - Object extraction and classification
#       - WCS Fitting
#       - Photometric zero point calculation
#       - Filing of DQC information
#       - Display of the final dither frame.
#
 
# Notes:
#    None
 
# Output Data:
#    -  Interleaved super frames and confidence maps
#    -  All super frames are astrometrically and photometrically calibrated
 
# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None
 
# Timing:
#    {timing_information}
 
# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.
