# Name:
#    USTEP_JITTER_NOFLAT

# Purpose:
#    Standard processing for tile including interleaving, jittering.
#    No sky or flat correction is done.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe does the instrumental signature processing on frames and
#    then various combinations. This includes:
#       - Dark correction using a pre-existing master frame (no flat fielding)
#       - Interleaving
#       - Dithering
#       - Object extraction and classification
#       - WCS Fitting
#       - Photometric zero point calculation
#       - Filing of DQC information
#       - Display of the final dither frame.
#

# Notes:
#    -  Interleaving is only done after all the frames for the given jitter
#       sequence have arrived.

# Output Data:
#    -  Interleaved super frames and confidence maps
#    -  Dithered stacked frames and confidence maps.
#    -  All combined frames are astrometrically and photometrically calibrated

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.

#    None
