# Name:
#    SUBTRACT_DARK_CATALOGUE

# Purpose:
#    Subtract a dark frame from the current image and display it. A catalogue
#    is extracted and the results are displayed on the screen.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This is a very minimal recipe to do:
#       - Dark correction using a pre-existing master frame
#       - Display the dark corrected frame.
#       - Extract some objects and display some values on the screen

# Notes:
#    None

# Output Data:
#    -  A dark corrected image
#    -  A catalogue of extracted objects

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.
