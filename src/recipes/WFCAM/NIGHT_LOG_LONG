# Name:
#    NIGHT_LOG_LONG

# Purpose:
#    Creates a text log summarising file headers. Long version

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe is used to create a text long log summarising the file headers
#    of a group of observations. It is often used to create a log file
#    describing a whole night's worth of observations. For full details, see
#    the documentation for the _NIGHT_LOG_ primitive. This recipe calls the
#    primitive in such a way that the log file appears in $ORAC_DATA_IN.
#    An "on-the-fly" night log is created in $ORAC_DATA_OUT as data is reduced
#    by the pipeline.

# Notes:
#    None

# Output Data:
#    None

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None

# Timing:

=head1 NAME

NIGHT_LOG_LONG - creates a text log summarising file headers. Long version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used to create a long text log summarising the file headers
of a group of observations. It is often used to create a log file
describing a whole night's worth of observations.

For full details, see the documentation for the
_NIGHT_LOG_ primitive.

This recipe calls the primitive in such a way that the log file
appears in $ORAC_DATA_IN.

An "on-the-fly" night log is created in $ORAC_DATA_OUT as
data is reduced by the pipeline.
