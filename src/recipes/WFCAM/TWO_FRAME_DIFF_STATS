# Name:
#    TWO_FRAME_DIFF_STATS

# Purpose:
#    Take two frames and forms a difference.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe waits until you have two frames in a group and then 
#    subtracts one from the other. The resulting frame is then available
#    for the user to do whatever statistical analysis he/she/it wants.

# Notes:
#    None

# Output Data:
#    -  A FITS image with the difference of the two frames (first minus second)

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.

# References:
#    None

# Related Recipes:
#    None
