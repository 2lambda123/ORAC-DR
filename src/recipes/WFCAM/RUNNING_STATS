# Name:
#    RUNNING__STATS

# Purpose:
#    Do running statistics on a each pixel in series of frames

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe takes a series of frames and does running stats on each
#    pixel. The results are written to a data cube.

# Notes:
#    None

# Output Data:
#    -  A FITS image with the stats in planes of a data cube

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.
