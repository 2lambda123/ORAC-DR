# Name:
#    WFCAM_CIRSI_FLATCOMBINE

# Purpose:
#     Combine dummy WFCAM flat field data and form a mean flat

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe combines dummy WFCAM flat field files into a mean flat.
#

# Notes:
#    -  This is not intended to be part of a first pass WFCAM pipeline and 
#       only is intended for a particular dataset.
#

# Output Data:
#    -  A mean flat field and initial confidence map.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    none

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.

# References:
#    none

# Related Recipes:
#    none

WFCAM_CIRSI_FLATCOMBINE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe takes flat field exposures and creates a mean flat and initial
confidence map.  This is for dummy WFCAM data only.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This is B<not> part of a first pass WFCAM pipeline.  It's intended only for 
use in defining some of the WFCAM class files and for testing an installation 
of CIRDR. If you want to use this, you'll need to get the test dataset.
