# Name:
#    DARK_COMBINE

# Purpose:
#    Recipe for combining a series of dark exposures.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe combines a series of dark exposures. If there are a series
#    of dark frames, then as each one comes in, it blows away the previous
#    mean frame and creates a new one, until the dark series has been finished.
#    The results are filed in an index.

# Notes:
#    None

# Output Data:
#    -  A master dark frame

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.
