# Name:
#    RUNNING_CHANNEL_STATS

# Purpose:
#    Do running statistics on a each channel in series of frames

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe takes a series of frames and breaks the images into their
#    constituent channels. Running stats are done on each channel and written
#    to an output FITS table.

# Notes:
#    None

# Output Data:
#    -  A FITS table with the running statistics for each channel.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.
