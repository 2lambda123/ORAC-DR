# Name:
#    FOCUS_REDUCE

# Purpose:
#    Determine the focus of the instrument from a series of exposures taken
#    with various focus offsets.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    The input to this recipe should be a multi-image file where each image
#    is an exposure taken at a different focus offset. The recipe then does
#    the following:
#       - Dark correction and flat fielding using a pre-existing master frame
#       - A simple object extraction
#    The mean FWHM of each frame is written to the screen along with the
#    focus offsets.
#

# Notes:
#    None

# Output Data:
#    -  A processed MEF and a basic catalogue

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.
