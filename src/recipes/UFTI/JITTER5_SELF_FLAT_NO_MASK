# Name:
#    JITTER5_SELF_FLAT_NO_MASK

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a 5-point "standard jitter" photometry observation.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
#    with UFTI data.  It takes an UFTI observation comprising five
#    object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed
#    mosaic automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field creation and division, feature
#    detection and matching between object frames, and resampling.

#    This recipe works well for faint sources and sparse fields.

# Notes: 
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  The flat field is created by combining normalised object
#    frames using the clipped median at each pixel.
#    -  Registration is performed using common point sources in the
#    overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
#    objects, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of five, the recipe creates a mosaic, which has
#    its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
#    improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
#    stored in the mosaic's EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass
#    header, AMEND, is updated to match that of the last-observed frame
#    contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in g<date>_<group_number>_mos.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of four in
#    g<date>_<group_number>_mos_<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in f<date>_<obs_number>_ff.
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<group_number>subgrp for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<group_number>subgrp_<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern. [5]

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK
#    KAPPA, and PISA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Error propagation is not used.

=head1 NAME

JITTER5_SELF_FLAT_NO_MASK -- Reduces a 5-point "standard jitter" photometry observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
with UFTI data.  It takes an UFTI observation comprising five
object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed
mosaic automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flat-field creation and division, feature
detection and matching between object frames, and resampling.

This recipe works well for faint sources and for sparse
fields.

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.

=item *

The flat field is created by combining normalised object frames
using the clipped median at each pixel.

=item *

Registration is performed using common point sources in the
overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
objects, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
transformed to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
time (the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of five, the recipe creates a mosaic, which has
its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
stored in the mosaic's EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass
header, AMEND, is updated to match that of the last-observed frame
contributing to the mosaic.

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames.
