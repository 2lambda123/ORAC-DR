# Name:
#    BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a bright-point-source photometry observation.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces a "bright standard" photometry observation
#    with UFTI data.  It takes an UFTI observation comprising a
#    series of object frames and a dark frame, and a predetermined
#    flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic
#    automatically.

#    This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
#    between object frames, and resampling.  See the notes for details.

#    As the name implies, it is intended for bright point sources,
#    such as standard stars.

# Notes:
#    -  You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
#    the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
#    to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
#    give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.  The
#    mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time (that being the
#    exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of five, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
#    is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise.
#    The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass header, AMEND, is
#    updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing to
#    the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The resultant mosaic in g<date>_<group_number>_mos.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in f<date>_<obs_number>_ff.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern. [5]

# Timing:
#    This is a fast recipe and will keep pace with observations.

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK
#    and KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Error propagation is not used.

BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE -- Reduces a bright-point-source photometry observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "bright standard" photometry observation
with UFTI data.  It takes an UFTI observation comprising a
series of object frames and a dark frame, and a predetermined
flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic
automatically.

This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
between object frames, and resampling.  See the notes for details.

As the name implies, it is intended for bright point sources,
such as standard stars.

=item * 

You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item * 

Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item * 

The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.  The
mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time (that being the
exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of five, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise.
The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass header, AMEND, is
updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing to
the mosaic.
