# Name:
#    BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a bright-point-source photometry observation.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces a "bright standard" photometry observation
#    with UFTI or IRCAM data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
#    a series of jittered object frames and a dark frame, and a
#    predetermined flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed
#    mosaic automatically.

#    This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
#    between object frames, and resampling.  See the "Notes" for details.

#    As the name implies, it is intended for bright point sources,
#    such as standard stars.

# Notes:
#    -  You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
#    the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
#    to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
#    give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.  The
#    mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time (that being the
#    exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
#    noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    EXP_TIME (UFTI) or DEXPTIME (IRCAM) header.  Likewise the end 
#    airmass header, AMEND, is updated to match that of the last-observed
#    frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The resultant mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "g" for UFTI and "rg" for IRCAM.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "ro" for IRCAM.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern.  If this is not 
#       set, the number of offsets, as given by FITS header NOFFSETS,
#       minus one is used.  If neither is available, 5 is the default.
#       An error state arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer
#       than 3.  For observations prior to the availability of full
#       ORAC, header NOFFSETS will be absent.  []

# Timing:
#    This is a fast recipe and will keep pace with observations.

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK
#    and KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Error propagation is not used.

BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE -- Reduces a bright-point-source photometry observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "bright standard" photometry observation with
UFTI or IRCAM data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising a
series of jittered object frames and a dark frame, and a predetermined
flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic automatically.

This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
between object frames, and resampling.  See the L<"NOTES"> for details.

As the name implies, it is intended for bright point sources,
such as standard stars.

=item * 

You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item * 

For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item * 

Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item * 

The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.  The
mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time (that being the
exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise. The
exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's EXP_TIME
(UFTI) or DEXPTIME (IRCAM) header.  Likewise the end airmass header,
AMEND, is updated to match that of the last-observed frame
contributing to the mosaic.

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames.

=item NUMBER = INTEGER

The number of frames in the jitter pattern.  If this is not set,
the number of offsets, as given by FITS header NOFFSETS, minus
one is used.  If neither is available, 9 is the default.  An
error state arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer
than 3.  For observations prior to the availability of full
ORAC, header NOFFSETS will be absent.  []
