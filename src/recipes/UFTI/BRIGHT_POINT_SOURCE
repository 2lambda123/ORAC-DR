# Name:
#    BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a bright-point-source photometry observation.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces a "bright standard" photometry observation
#    with UFTI data.  It takes an UFTI observation comprising a
#    series of object frames and a dark frame with a predetermined
#    flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic
#    automatically.

#    This recipe performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
#    between object frames, and resampling. 

# Notes:
#    -  You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.
#    -  Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
#    the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
#    to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
#    give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.

# Startup
# =======
#
# Every recipe must do this.
    _UFTI_HELLO_

# This gets done for the first frame in sequence
    _BRIGHT_POINT_SOURCE_HELLO_

# Set up steering control of the processing, namely when to make a flat,
# make a mosaic.

# Calibration
# ===========
#
# The following operations are preformed for every appropriate frame.

# Apply the bad pixel mask.
    _MASK_BAD_PIXELS_

# Remove the bias.
    _REMOVE_BIAS_

# Subtract the dark frame.
    _SUBTRACT_DARK_

# Flat field using a pre-existing calibration frame.
    _DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_

# Determine the linear offsets between the object frames in the group
# by pattern matching common features.  Register the frames using a shift
# of pixel origin.
    _GENERATE_OFFSETS_JITTER_

# Apply rotation, resample each frame, and tesselate.  The mosaic is
# trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.

# Remove intermediate data files.

=head1  Purpose:

Reduces a bright-point-source photometry observation.

=head1  Language:

Perl5

=head1  Description:

This script reduces a "bright standard" photometry observation
with UFTI data.  It takes an UFTI observation comprising a
series of object frames and a dark frame with a predetermined
flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic
automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction,
flatfield division, feature detection and matching between object
frames, resampling, and makes a mosaic.  The resampling applies
non-integer shifts of origin.

=head1 Notes:

You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.

Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
