# Name:
#    SKY_FLAT

# Purpose:
#    Creates and files a flat field derived from jittered frames.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe makes a sky flat from a series of sky or object frames
#    which are combined using one of a selection of statistics.  It expects
#    one dark frame followed by jittered sky frames.
#
#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, and dark subtraction
#    before combining normalised frames pixel by pixel using the median.
#    Details of the flat is filed in the index of flats for future
#    selection and use of the flat.
#
#    For best results the field observed should contain few stars and no
#    bright ones.  In contaminated sky regions, recipe SKY_FLAT_MASKED will
#    greatly reduce artifacts appearing in the resultant flat.
#
# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The flat is called flat_<group_number>.
#    -  The flat is filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter.  If absent, the number of
#       offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS, minus one is used.  If
#       neither is available, 5 is used.  An error state arises if
#       the number of jittered frames is fewer than 3.  []

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages CCDPACK
#    and KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through the intermediate file
#    to the flat.
#    -  Error propagation is not used.

SKY_FLAT -- Creates and files a flat field derived from jittered frames.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe makes a sky flat from a series of sky or object frames
which are combined using one of a selection of statistics.  It expects
one dark frame followed by jittered sky frames.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, and dark subtraction
before combining normalised frames pixel by pixel using the median.
Details of the flat is filed in the index of flats for future
selection and use of the flat.

For best results the field observed should contain few stars and no
bright ones.  In contaminated sky regions, recipe SKY_FLAT_MASKED will
greatly reduce artifacts appearing in the resultant flat.
