# Name:
#    REDUCE_DARK

# Purpose:
#    File an observation as the current dark.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces a dark frame observation with UFTI
#    data.  It files the dark in file $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.dark.
#    Reduction is only bad-pixel masking.

# Notes:
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The dark is called dark_<frame_number>.
#    -  The dark is filed in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.dark>.

# Timing:
#    Of the order of a few seconds on an Ultra 5.

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through the intermediate file
#    to the dark.
#    -  Error propagation is not used.
