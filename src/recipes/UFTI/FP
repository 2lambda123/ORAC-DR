# Description:
#    This script reduces a Fabry-Perot observation with UFTI data.
#    It takes an UFTI observation comprising eight object frames and a
#    dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.
#
#    The sequence of frames expected in the observations are tabulated
#    below.

#         1     On  source    On  line
#         2     Off source    On  line

#         7     Off source    Off line, negative offset
#         8     On  source    Off line, negative offset
#
#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction,
#    pairwise frame differencing, flat-field division, integer shifts of 
#    origin to register, and mosaicking.  The desired result is given by
#
#         [(#1 - #2)-(#4 - #3)] + [(#5 - #6)-(#8 - #7)]  
#         ---------------------------------------------
#                          Flat Field
#
#    where #n is the bad-pixel masked and dark subtracted frame n.
#    In practice, the flat field is applied to each differenced pair,
#    such as (#4 - #3), when the pair becomes available, rather than
#    waiting until all eight frames have been observed.

# Notes: 
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  You may use SKY_FLAT_FP to make the flat field.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  There is no resampling, merely integer shifts of origin.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of eight, the recipe creates a mosaic, which is
#    then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The
#    exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's EXP_TIME
#    header.  Likewise the end airmass header, AMEND, is updated to match
#    that of the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in g<date>_<group_number>_mos.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of eight in
#    g<date>_<group_number>_mos_<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in f<date>_<obs_number>_ff.

# Timing:

FP -- Reduces an 8-frame Fabry-Perot observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a Fabry-Perot observation with UFTI data.
It takes an UFTI observation comprising eight object frames and a
dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

The sequence of frames expected in the observations are tabulated
below.

   Frame    Position            Wavelength
   -----   ----------    -------------------------
     1     On  source    On  line
     2     Off source    On  line
     3     Off source    Off line, positive offset
     4     On  source    Off line, positive offset
     5     On  source    On  line
     6     Off source    On  line
     7     Off source    Off line, negative offset
     8     On  source    Off line, negative offset>


It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction,
pairwise frame differencing, flat-field division, integer shifts of 
origin to register, and mosaicking.  The desired result is given by

    [(#1 - #2)-(#4 - #3)] + [(#5 - #6)-(#8 - #7)]      
    ---------------------------------------------
                      Flat Field

where #I<n> is the bad-pixel masked and dark subtracted frame I<n>.
In practice, the flat field is applied to each differenced pair,
such as (#4 - #3), when the pair becomes available, rather than
waiting until all eight frames have been observed.
