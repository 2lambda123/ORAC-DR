#    ARRAY_TESTS

#  Purpose:
#    Calculates the STARE and ND_STARE readout noises and dark current.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script calculates the STARE and ND_STARE readout noises,
#    and the dark current from a series of engineering data taken
#    with the EXEC called ARRAY_TESTS.  The results are compared with
#    the nominal values, and you are notified whether or not the values
#    obtained are within limits.  The results are also logged to an
#    engineering file for archival purposes.
