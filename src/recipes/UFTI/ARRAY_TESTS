#  Name:
#    ARRAY_TESTS

#  Purpose:
#    Calculates the ND_STARE readout noise and dark current.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script calculates the STARE and ND_STARE readout noises,
#    and the dark current from a series of engineering data taken
#    with the EXEC called ARRAY_TESTS.  The results are compared with
#    the nominal values, and you are notified whether or not the values
#    obtained are within limits.  The results are also logged to an
#    engineering file for archival purposes.

# Notes:
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  The engineering log contains the UT date and time, the ND_STARE
#    readout noise, and the dark current.  The results are normally
#    appended to the log.  If for some reason it does not exist, a new
#    log is created containing the column headings.
#    -  Multiple array tests are permitted.  A new set of results is
#    reported and logged for each cycle.

# Output Data:
#    -  The engineering log: /ukirt_sw/logs/ufti_array_tests.log.

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink package KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.

This script calculates the STARE and ND_STARE readout noises,
and the dark current from a series of engineering data taken
with the EXEC called ARRAY_TESTS.  The results are compared with
the nominal values, and you are notified whether or not the values
obtained are within limits.  The results are also logged to an
engineering file for archival purposes.

The engineering log contains the UT date and time, the ND_STARE
readout noise, and the dark current.  The results are normally
appended to the log.  If for some reason it does not exist, a new
log is created containing the column headings.

Multiple array tests are permitted.  A new set of results is
