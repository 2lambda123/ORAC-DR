=head1 Description:
     This script calculates the STARE and ND_STARE readout noises,
     and the dark current from a series of engineering data taken
     with the EXEC called ARRAY_TESTS.  The results are compared with
     the nominal values, and you are notified whether or not the values
     obtained are within limits.  The results are also logged to an
     engineering file for archival purposes.
