# Name:
#    MOVING_JITTER9_SELF_FLAT

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a 9-point "standard jitter" photometry observation of a
#    moving target using object masking.     

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
#    with UFTI data.  It takes an observation comprising nine
#    object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed
#    mosaic automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field creation and division, feature
#    detection and matching between object frames, and resampling.
#    Registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
#    target using ephemeris data stored in file target_ephem.txt.
#    See "Ephemeris-file Format" for details of this file's format.

#    This recipe works well for faint moving sources and in moderately
#    crowded fields.  It should not be used for frames where the
#    telescope guided on the moving object.  In that case reduction
#    should be performed by JITTER9_SELF_FLAT_TELE which registers
#    using the telescope offsets alone.

# Notes: 
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  The flat field is created iteratively.  First an approximate
#    flat-field is created by combining normalised object frames using
#    the median at each pixel.  This flat field is applied to the object
#    frames.  Sources within the flat-fielded frames are detected, and
#    masked in the dark-subtracted frames.  The first stage is repeated
#    but applied to the masked frames to create the final flat field.
#    -  Registration is performed using common point sources in the
#    overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
#    objects, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.  Once the offsets are determined, they
#    are adjusted for the motion of the target, so that the final
#    mosaic registers the target, not the background stars.
#    -  The ephemeris file is specified by environment variable
#    ORAC_EPHEMERIS, defaulting to $ORAC_DATA_OUT/target_ephem.dat.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of nine, the recipe creates a mosaic, which has
#    its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
#    improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
#    stored in the mosaic's EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass
#    header, AMEND, is updated to match that of the last-observed frame
#    contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Ephemeris-file Format:
#   The current format of the ephemeris file is one line per object
#   comprising three space-separated fields in the following order:
#     - the objectname, which may contain embedded spaces; 
#     - the motion in the plane of the sky in arcsec/second for right
#     ascension then declination.
#
#   Note that the right ascension motion is the change in right ascension
#   multiplied by the cosine of the declination.  The format will change
#   to include UT and possibly date.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in g<date>_<group_number>_mos.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of four in
#    g<date>_<group_number>_mos_<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in f<date>_<obs_number>_ff.
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<group_number>subgrp for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<group_number>subgrp_<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern. [9]

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK
#    KAPPA, and PISA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Error propagation is not used.

MOVING_JITTER9_SELF_FLAT -- Reduces a 9-point "standard jitter" photometry observation of a moving target using object masking.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
with UFTI data.  It takes an observation comprising nine
object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed
mosaic automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flat-field creation and division, feature
detection and matching between object frames, and resampling.
Registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
target using ephemeris data stored in file target_ephem.txt.
See "EPHEMERIS-FILE FORMAT" for details of this file's format.

This recipe works well for faint moving sources and in moderately
crowded fields.  It should not be used for frames where the
telescope guided on the moving object.  In that case reduction
should be performed by L<JITTER9_SELF_FLAT_TELE> which registers
using the telescope offsets alone.
