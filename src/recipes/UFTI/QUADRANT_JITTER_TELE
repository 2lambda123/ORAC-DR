# Name:
#    QUADRANT_JITTER_TELE

# Purpose:
#    "Quadrant Jitter" standard reduction including object masking,
#    but registered using telescope offsets.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "quadrant jitter" photometry observation
#    with UFTI data.  It takes an UFTI observation comprising one or
#    more series of four object frames where the target is
#    approximately centred in each quadrant; and a dark frame to make
#    a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

#    It performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark subtraction,
#    flat-field creation and division, registration using telescope
#    offsets, and resampling.

#    This recipe is suitable for faint objects or objects within
#    a comparatively bright core embedded in faint extended emission,
#    e.g. a quasar.  The object need not be isolated, as the recipe
#    masks objects within the other quadrants, and hence does not
#    introduce significant artifacts into the flat field.  For isolated
#    objects use QUADRANT_JITTER_NO_MASK; or where speed is critical, 
#    use QUADRANT_JITTER_BASIC instead.

# Notes: 
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  The flat field is created iteratively.  First the quadrant
#    containing the object is masked in each object frame.  Second an
#    approximate flat field is created by combining the normalised
#    and masked object frames using the clipped median at each pixel.
#    This flat field is applied to the object frames.  Sources within
#    the flat-fielded frames are detected, and masked in the
#    dark-subtracted frames.  The second stage is repeated but applied
#    to the masked frames to create the final flat field.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame.  Thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The full signal will be in the central ninth
#    containing the main object.
#    -  For each cycle of four, the recipe creates a mosaic, which has
#    its bad pixels filled and is then co-added into a master mosaic of
#    improving signal to noise.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in g<date>_<group_number>_mos.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of four in
#    g<date>_<group_number>_mos_<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in f<date>_<obs_number>_ff.
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<group_number>subgrp for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<group_number>subgrp_<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK
#    KAPPA, and PISA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files

Perl5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "quadrant jitter" photometry observation
with UFTI data.  It takes an UFTI observation comprising one or
more series of four object frames where the target is
approximately centred in each quadrant; and a dark frame to make
a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

It performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark subtraction,
flat-field creation and division, registration using telescope
offsets, and resampling.

This recipe is suitable for faint objects or objects within
a comparatively bright core embedded in faint extended emission,
e.g. a quasar.  The object need not be isolated, as the recipe
masks objects within the other quadrants, and hence does not
introduce significant artifacts into the flat field.  For isolated
objects use QUADRANT_JITTER_NO_MASK; or where speed is critical, 
use QUADRANT_JITTER_BASIC instead.

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

The flat field is created iteratively.  First the quadrant
containing the object is masked in each object frame.  Second an
approximate flat field is created by combining the normalised
and masked object frames using the clipped median at each pixel.
This flat field is applied to the object frames.  Sources within
the flat-fielded frames are detected, and masked in the
dark-subtracted frames.  The second stage is repeated but applied
to the masked frames to create the final flat field.

=item *

Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
transformed to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame.  Thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
less exposure time.  The full signal will be in the central ninth
containing the main object.

=item *

For each cycle of four, the recipe creates a mosaic, which has
its bad pixels filled and is then co-added into a master mosaic of
improving signal to noise.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames, and the flat fields.
