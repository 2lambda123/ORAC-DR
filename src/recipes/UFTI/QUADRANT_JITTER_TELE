# Name:
#    QUADRANT_JITTER_TELE

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "Quadrant Jitter" observation, using object masking,
#    and telescope offsets for registration.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "quadrant jitter" photometry observation
#    with UFTI or IRCAM data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
#    one or more series of four object frames where the target is
#    approximately centred in each quadrant; and a dark frame to make
#    a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

#    It performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark subtraction,
#    flat-field creation and division, registration using telescope
#    offsets, and resampling.  See the "Notes" for further information. 

#    This recipe is intended for extended moving sources (comets)
#    tracked by the telescope.  The source extent should not exceed 45
#    arcseconds for UFTI or 10 arcseconds for IRCAM, in moderately
#    crowded fields.  Sources may include those with a comparatively
#    bright core embedded in faint extended emission.  The object need
#    not be isolated, as the recipe masks objects within the other
#    quadrants, and hence does not introduce significant artifacts into
#    the flat field.  This recipe should not be used for frames where
#    the telescope has not guided on the moving object.  In that case
#    reduction should be performed by MOVING_QUADRANT_JITTER, which
#    corrects the registration for the motion of the source using an
#    ephemeris.

# Notes: 
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is created iteratively.  First the quadrant
#    containing the object is masked in each object frame.  Second an
#    approximate flat field is created by combining the normalised
#    and masked object frames using the clipped median at each pixel.
#    This flat field is applied to the object frames.  Sources within
#    the flat-fielded frames are detected, and masked in the
#    dark-subtracted frames.  The second stage is repeated but applied
#    to the masked frames to create the final flat field.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame.  Thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The full signal will be in the central ninth
#    containing the main object.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
#    exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of four, the recipe creates a mosaic, which has
#    its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
#    improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
#    stored in the mosaic's EXP_TIME (UFTI) or DEXPTIME (IRCAM) header. 
#    Likewise the end airmass header, AMEND, is updated to match that of
#    the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively.

#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the

QUADRANT_JITTER_TELE -- Reduces a "Quadrant Jitter" observation, using object masking, and telescope offsets for registration.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "quadrant jitter" photometry observation with
UFTI or IRCAM data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising one or
more series of four object frames where the target is approximately
centred in each quadrant; and a dark frame to make a calibrated,
untrimmed mosaic automatically.

It performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark subtraction,
flat-field creation and division, registration using telescope
offsets, and resampling.  See the L<"NOTES"> for further information. 

This recipe is intended for extended moving sources (comets) tracked
by the telescope.  The source extent should not exceed 45 arcseconds
for UFTI or 10 arcseconds for IRCAM, in moderately crowded fields.
Sources may include those with a comparatively bright core embedded in
faint extended emission.  The object need not be isolated, as the
recipe masks objects within the other quadrants, and hence does not
introduce significant artifacts into the flat field.  This recipe
should not be used for frames where the telescope has not guided on
the moving object.  In that case reduction should be performed by
L<MOVING_QUADRANT_JITTER|MOVING_QUADRANT_JITTER>, which corrects the
registration for the motion of the source using an ephemeris.
