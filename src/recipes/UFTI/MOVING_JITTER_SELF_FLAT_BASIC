# Name:
#    MOVING_JITTER_SELF_FLAT_BASIC

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation of a
#    moving target using just the basic operations for speed.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
#    with UFTI data.  It takes an observation comprising jittered
#    object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed
#    mosaic automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field creation and division, amd integer shifts
#    of pixel origin to register to fixed sky co-ordinates.  The 
#    registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
#    target using ephemeris data stored in file target_ephem.txt.
#    See "Ephemeris-file Format" for details of this file's format.

#    This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming data.
#    It works well for faint moving sources and in moderately
#    crowded fields.  It should not be used for frames where the
#    telescope guided on the moving object.  In that case reduction
#    should be performed by JITTER_SELF_FLAT_TELE which registers
#    using the telescope offsets alone.

# Notes: 
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  The flat field is created by combining normalised object 
#    frames using the median at each pixel.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.  Once the offsets are determined, they
#    are adjusted for the motion of the target, so that the final
#    mosaic registers the target, not the background stars.
#    -  There is no resampling, merely integer shifts of origin.
#    -  The ephemeris file is specified by environment variable
#    ORAC_EPHEMERIS, defaulting to $ORAC_DATA_OUT/target_ephem.dat.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
#    noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass header, AMEND, is updated
#    to match that of the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Ephemeris-file Format:
#    The current format of the ephemeris file is one line per object
#    comprising three space-separated fields in the following order:
#      - the objectname, which may contain embedded spaces; and
#      - the motion in the plane of the sky in arcsec/second for right
#    ascension then declination.
#
#    Note that the right-ascension motion is the change in right ascension
#    multiplied by the cosine of the declination.  The format may change
#    to include UT and possibly date.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in g<date>_<group_number>_mos.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of jittered frames in
#    g<date>_<group_number>_mos_<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in f<date>_<obs_number>_ff.
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<group_number>subgrp for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<group_number>subgrp_<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern.  If not supplied
#       the number of offsets, as given by FITS header NOFFSETS, minus
#       one is used.  If neither is available, 9 is the default.  An
#       error state arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer
#       than 3.  For observations prior to the availability of full
#       ORAC, header NOFFSETS will be absent.  []

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK
#    and KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Error propagation is not used.

MOVING_JITTER_SELF_FLAT_BASIC -- Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation of a moving target using just the basic operations for speed.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
with UFTI data.  It takes an observation comprising jittered
object frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed
mosaic automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flat-field creation and division, amd integer shifts
of pixel origin to register to fixed sky co-ordinates.  The 
registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
target using ephemeris data stored in file F<target_ephem.txt>.
See L<"EPHEMERIS-FILE FORMAT"> for details of this file's format.

This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming data.
It works well for faint moving sources and in moderately
crowded fields.  It should not be used for frames where the
telescope guided on the moving object.  In that case reduction
should be performed by L<JITTER_SELF_FLAT_TELE> which registers
using the telescope offsets alone.
