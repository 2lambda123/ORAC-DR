# Name:
#    FP_JITTER

# Purpose:
#    Reduces spatially jittered sets of 8-frame Fabry-Perot observations.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a Fabry-Perot observation with UFTI data.  It
#    takes an imaging observation comprising at least three sets of eight
#    object frames, each set being for a different telescope position.
#    The recipe combines these with a dark frame and a separate flat, to 
#    make a continuum-subtracted and sky-subtracted, untrimmed mosaic
#    automatically.
#
#    Each sequence of eight frames expected in each spatial position are
#    tabulated below.
#
#       Frame    Position            Wavelength
#       -----   ----------    -------------------------
#         1     On  source    On  line
#         2     Off source    On  line
#         3     Off source    Off line, positive offset
#         4     On  source    Off line, positive offset
#         5     On  source    On  line
#         6     Off source    On  line
#         7     Off source    Off line, negative offset
#         8     On  source    Off line, negative offset
#
#    For each spatial set, the recipe performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel 
#    masking, dark subtraction, pairwise frame differencing, flat-field
#    division, integer shifts of origin to register, and mosaicking.  The
#    wavelength-shifted mosaic is given by 
#
#         [(#1 - #2)-(#4 - #3)] + [(#5 - #6)-(#8 - #7)]  
#         ---------------------------------------------
#                          Flat Field
#
#    where #n is the bad-pixel masked and dark subtracted frame n.
#    In practice, the flat field is applied to each differenced pair,
#    such as (#4 - #3), when the pair becomes available, rather than
#    waiting until all eight frames have been observed.
#
#    Finally the recipe registers all the wavelength mosaics spatially, and a
#    forms a untrimmed mosaic, combined using the median to reduce stellar
#    artifacts.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is 
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard 
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  You should use SKY_FLAT_FP to make the flat field.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  There is no resampling, merely integer shifts of origin.
#    -  For each set of eight, the recipe creates a wavelength mosaic.
#    For each cycle of spatial positions the wavelength mosaics are
#    registered to form a spatial mosaic.  For repeat cycles the spatial
#    mosaic is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
#    noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the master
#    mosaic's EXP_TIME header. Likewise the end airmass header, AMEND,
#    is updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing to
#    the mosaic.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    No mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus the
#    noise will be greater in the peripheral areas of the spatial having
#    received less exposure time.  Each mosaic is not normalised by its
#    exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in gf<date>_<group_number>_mos.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of eight in
#    <gf<date>_<group_number>_mos_w<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <f<date>_<obs_number>_ff.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NPAIRS = INTEGER
#       The number of frame pairs to be differenced.  It must be a multiple
#       of 2 otherwise 4 is assumed.  A value of four or more is assumed to
#       indicate sky subtraction.  [4]
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of spatial jitter positions.  For each spatial position 
#       there are NPAIRS pairs of frames.  A value of 1 also dictates
#       that no jittering has occurred.  To make a master mosaic combining
#       spatial positions, NUMBER should be at least 3.  [1]

FP_JITTER -- Reduces spatially jittered sets of 8-frame Fabry-Perot observations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a Fabry-Perot observation with UFTI data.  It
takes an imaging observation comprising at least three sets of eight
object frames, each set being for a different telescope position.
The recipe combines these with a dark frame and a separate flat, to 
make a continuum-subtracted and sky-subtracted, untrimmed mosaic
automatically.

Each sequence of eight frames expected in the observations are tabulated
below.

   Frame    Position            Wavelength
   -----   ----------    -------------------------
     1     On  source    On  line
     2     Off source    On  line
     3     Off source    Off line, positive offset
     4     On  source    Off line, positive offset
     5     On  source    On  line
     6     Off source    On  line
     7     Off source    Off line, negative offset
     8     On  source    Off line, negative offset


It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction,
pairwise frame differencing, flat-field division, integer shifts of 
origin to register, and mosaicking.  The desired result is given by

    [(#1 - #2)-(#4 - #3)] + [(#5 - #6)-(#8 - #7)]      
    ---------------------------------------------
                      Flat Field

where #I<n> is the bad-pixel masked and dark subtracted frame I<n>.
In practice, the flat field is applied to each differenced pair,
such as (#4 - #3), when the pair becomes available, rather than
waiting until all eight frames have been observed.

Finally the recipe registers all the wavelength mosaics spatially, and a
forms an untrimmed mosaic, combined using the median to reduce stellar
artifacts.

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which

The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector

For each set of eight, the recipe creates a wavelength mosaic.  For
each cycle of spatial positions the wavelength mosaics are registered
to form a spatial mosaic.  For repeat cycles the spatial mosaic is
then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The
exposure time is also summed and stored in the master mosaic's
EXP_TIME header.  Likewise the end airmass header, AMEND, is updated
to match that of the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
No mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus the
noise will be greater in the peripheral areas of the spatial having
received less exposure time.  Each mosaic is not normalised by its
exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
