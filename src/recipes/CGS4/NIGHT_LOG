=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The text log file $ORAC_DATA_IN/E<lt>dateE<gt>.nightlog, where
E<lt>dateE<gt> is the UT date.
This should be 132 columns or less wide

The file is in $ORAC_DATA_OUT if the OUT argument to the
C<_NIGHT_LOG_> primitive is set (to any value), so we can build a
seperate on-the-fly log.
