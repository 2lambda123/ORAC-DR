=head1 NAME

ARRAY_TESTS - tests the array, determining the readnoise and dark current.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Performs array tests for an array. This recipe uses the raw data,
reduces it, and calculates read noise, median and modal dark currents
for the array. It assumes that data is taken in the standard CGS4
array tests configuration .

See the _ARRAY_TESTS_ CGS4 primitive for details.
