=head1 DESCIPTION

This recipe reduces a standard star observation, assuming that it is
observed in a conventional nod-along-slit manner. It extracts the
spectrum of the standard, aquires details of the star (either from a
locally held list, or from SIMBAD), and files it such that it can be
later used to create divided by standard and flux calibrated spectra
of targets that are observed.
