=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCIENCE - Reduce an ACSIS science observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces an ACSIS science observation. It does so by first
converting a time-series cube (or more than one, as the case may be)
as written by the ACSIS specwriter into a spatial/spectral cube. This
cube is then coadded to other cubes in the same group to form a higher
signal-to-noise ratio cube.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This recipe is suitable for ACSIS using either the RxA3i or HARP
backends.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

A spatial/spectral cube whose filename is of the form
aYYYYMMDD_NNNNN_SS_MMMM_cube.sdf, where YYYYMMDD is the UT date, NNNNN
is the zero-padded observation number, SS is the zero-padded subsystem
number, and MMMM is the first zero-padded sub-scan number for the
given observation and subsystem.

=item *

A spatial/spectral cube whose filename is of the form gaYYYYMMDD_N,
where YYYYMMDD is the UT date, and N is the group number. This is the
coadded group file.
