REDUCE_SCIENCE_CADC - Reduce an ACSIS science observation at CADC.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used for generic ACSIS data processing at the CADC. It has not been tuned for any specific type of data.

This recipe first creates a spatial cube from the raw time series
data. Then, working on the raw time series data, it subtracts a median
time-series signal, thresholds the data, then trims the ends of the
frequency range to remove high-noise regions.

After the time-series manipulation has been done to every member of
the current group, every member is run through MAKECUBE to create a
group spatial cube. This cube then has its baseline removed through a
smoothing process, and moments maps are created.

A baseline mask formed from the group cube is run through UNMAKECUBE
to form baseline masks for the input time-series data, which are then
baselined. The baselined time-series data are then run through
MAKECUBE to create observation cubes, from which moments maps are
created.

The 'nearest' method is used for creating cubes with MAKECUBE.

For individual time-series data: median time-series removed with the
_tss suffix; thresholded data with the _thr suffix; frequency ends
removed with the _em suffix; baseline-only mask with the _tsmask
suffix; non-baseline regions masked with the _msk suffix; baselined
data with the _bl suffix.
