=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCIENCE_GRADIENT - Reduces an ACSIS science observation using
advanced algorithms.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used for advanced generic ACSIS data processing. It has
not been tuned for any specific type of data.

This recipe first creates a spatial cube from the raw time series
data. Then, working on the raw time series data, it subtracts a median
time-series signal, thresholds the data, then trims the ends of the
frequency range to remove high-noise regions.  Receptors with
non-linear baselines and spectra affected by transient high-frequency
noise may be rejected.

After the time-series manipulation has been done to every member of
the current group, every member is run through MAKECUBE to create a
group spatial cube. This cube then has its baseline removed through a
smoothing process, and moments maps are created.

A baseline mask formed from the group cube is run through UNMAKECUBE
to form baseline masks for the input time-series data, which are then
baselined. The baselined time-series data are then run through
MAKECUBE to create observation cubes, from which moments maps are
created.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This recipe is suitable for ACSIS data.

=item *

The 'nearest' method is used for creating cubes with MAKECUBE.

=item *

The spatial smoothing has a three-pixel kernel, while frequency
smooths over 25 pixels.  Both use block averaging.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 4

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY

If set to true (1) receptors with mostly or all non-linear baselines
are excluded from the reduced products.  [1]

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY_CLIP

This is used to reject receptors that have non-linear baselines.
It is the maximum number of standard deviations above the median rms
deviations for which a detector's non-linearity is regarded as
acceptable.  The minimum allowed is 2.  A comma-separated list will
perform iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations
in the list should not decrease.  ["2.0,2.3,3.0"]

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY_LINEWIDTH

This is used to reject receptors that have non-linear baselines.
It is the extent of the source spectral line measured in km/s, which
is excluded from the non-linearity tests.  It is also used to detect
transient non-linear baselines (cf. LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE).  This may be
given as either a velocity range, the bounds being separated by a
colon; or as a single value being the width about zero.  For instance
"-20:50" would excise the region -20 to +50 km/s, and "30" would
exclude the -15 to +15 km/s range.  ["40.0"]

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY_MINRMS

This is used to retain receptors that have noisy or slightly non-linear
baselines, or transient bad baselines (cf. LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE).
The parameter is the minimum rms deviation from linearity, measured in
antenna temperature, for a receptor to be flagged as bad.  The
non-linearity identification intercompares the receptors and can
reject an outlier that in practice is not a bad receptor; it is just
worse than the other recptors in an observation.  This parameter
sets an absolute lower limit to prevent such receptors from being
excluded.  Values between 0.05 and 0.2 are normal.  Most good
receptors will be in 0.02 to 0.05 range.  [0.1]

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY_SCALELENGTH

This is used to reject receptors that have non-linear baselines.  It
is the smoothing scale length in whole pixels.  Features narrower than
this are filtered out during the background-level determination.  It
should be should be odd (if an even value is supplied, the next higher
odd value will be used) and sufficiently large to remove the noise
while not removing the low-frequency patterns in the spectra.  The
minimum allowed is 51.  It is also used to detect transient non-linear
baselines (cf. LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE).  [101]

=item BASELINE_ORDER

The polynomial order to use when baselining cubes.  [1]

=item CREATE_MOMENTS_USING_SNR

If set to true (1), moments maps will be created using a
signal-to-noise map to find emission regions. This could be useful
when observations were taken under differing sky conditions and thus
have different noise levels.  [0]

=item CUBE_WCS

The coordinate system to regrid the cubes to.  If undefined, the
system is determined from the data.  [undef]

=item FINAL_LOWER_VELOCITY

Set a lower velocity over which the final products, such as the
reduced and binned spectral cubes, and noise and rms images, are to be
created.  Unlike RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY, it permits the full
baselines to be used during processing, yet greatly reduces the
storage requirements of the final products by retaining only where the
astronomical signals reside.

It is typically used in conjunction with FINAL_UPPER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, there is no lower limit.  If FINAL_UPPER_VELOCITY is also
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends,
is used.  [undef]

=item FINAL_UPPER_VELOCITY

Set an upper velocity over which the final products, such as the
reduced and binned spectral cubes, and noise and rms images, are to be
created.  Unlike RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY, it permits the full
baselines to be used during processing, yet greatly reduces the
storage requirements of the final products by retaining only where the
astronomical signals reside.

It is typically used in conjunction with FINAL_LOWER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, there is no upper limit.  If FINAL_LOWER_VELOCITY is also
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends,
is used.  [undef]

=item FLATFIELD

Whether or not to perform flat-fielding.

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE

If set to true (1) the spectra for each receptor are analysed to
detect high-frequency interference noise, and those spectra deemed too
noisy are excluded from the reduced products.  [1]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_EDGE_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with high-frequency noise.  It is the
standard deviation to clip the summed-edginess profile iteratively in
order to measure the mean and standard deviation of the profile
unaffected by bad spectra.  A comma-separated list will perform
iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations in the
list should not decrease.  ["2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0"]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_THRESH_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with high-frequency noise.  This is the
number of standard deviations at which to threshold the noise profile
above its median level.  [4.0]

=item LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE

If set to true (1) the spectra for each receptor are analysed to
detect low-frequency interference ripples or bad baselines, and those
spectra deemed too deviant from linearity are excluded from the
reduced products.  [1]

=item LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE_EDGE_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with low-frequency interference.  It is the
standard deviation to clip the profile of summed-deviations from linearity
iteratively in order to measure the mean and standard deviation of the profile
unaffected by bad spectra.  A comma-separated list will perform
iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations in the
list should not decrease.  ["2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0"]

=item LOW_FREQ_INTERFERENCE_THRESH_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with low-frequency interference.  This is the
number of standard deviations at which to threshold the non-linearity profile
above its median level.  [3.0]

=item LV_IMAGE

A longitude-velocity map is made from the reduced group cube, if this
parameter is set to true (1).  The longitude here carries its generic
meaning, so it could equally well be right ascension or galactic
longitude; the actual axis derives from the chosen co-ordinate system
(see CUBE_WCS).  [undef]

=item MOMENTS

A comma-separated list of moments maps to create.  ["integ,iwc"]

=item MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY

Set a lower velocity over which the moments maps are to be created.
It is typically used in conjunction with MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is
used.  [undef]

=item MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY

Set an upper velocity over which the moments maps are to be created.
It is typically used in conjunction with MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is
used.  [undef]

=item PIXEL_SCALE

Pixel scale, in arcseconds, of cubes.  If undefined it is determined
from the data.  [undef]

=item REBIN

A comma-separated list of velocity resolutions to rebin the final cube
to.  If undefined, the observed resolution is used.  [undef]

=item RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this lower velocity.  It is typically used in
conjunction with RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY.  If undefined, the full
velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is used.  [undef]

=item RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this upper velocity.  It is typically used in
conjunction with RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY.  If undefined, the full
velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is used.  [undef]

=item SPREAD_METHOD

The method to use when spreading each input pixel value out between a
group of neighbouring output pixels when regridding cubes. See the
SPREAD parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for available spreading methods.
["nearest"]

=item SPREAD_WIDTH

The number of arcseconds on either side of the output position which
are to receive contributions from the input pixel. See the PARAMS
parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.  [0]

=item SPREAD_FWHM_OR_ZERO

Depending on the spreading method, this parameter controls the number
of arcseconds at which the envelope of the spreading function goes to
zero, or the full-width at half-maximum for the Gaussian envelope. See
the PARAMS parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.  [undef]

=item TILE

Whether or not to make tiled spectral cubes.  A true value (1)
performs tiling so as to restrict the data-processing resource
requirements.  Such tiled cubes abut each other in pixel co-ordinates
and may be pasted together to form the complete spectral cube.  [1]
