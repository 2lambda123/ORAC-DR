=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCIENCE_GRADIENT - Reduces an ACSIS science observation using
advanced algorithms.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used for advanced generic ACSIS data processing. It has
not been tuned for any specific type of data.

This recipe first creates a spatial cube from the raw time series
data. Then, working on the raw time series data, it subtracts a median
time-series signal, thresholds the data, then trims the ends of the
frequency range to remove high-noise regions.  Receptors with
non-linear baselines and spectra affected by transient high-frequency
noise may be rejected.

After the time-series manipulation has been done to every member of
the current group, every member is run through MAKECUBE to create a
group spatial cube. This cube then has its baseline removed through a
smoothing process, and moments maps are created.

A baseline mask formed from the group cube is run through UNMAKECUBE
to form baseline masks for the input time-series data, which are then
baselined. The baselined time-series data are then run through
MAKECUBE to create observation cubes, from which moments maps are
created.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 4

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY

If set to true (1) receptors with mostly or all non-linear baselines
are excluded from the reduced products.  [1]

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY_CLIP

This is used to reject receptors that have non-linear baselines.
It is the maximum number of standard deviations above the median rms
deviations for which a detector's non-linearity is regarded as
acceptable.  The minimum allowed is 2.  A comma-separated list will
perform iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations
in the list should not decrease.  ["2.0,2.3,3.0"]

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY_LINEWIDTH

This is used to reject receptors that have non-linear baselines.
It is the extent of the source spectral line measured in km/s, which
is excluded from the non-linearity tests.  It is also used to detect
transient non-linear baselines (cf. LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE).  [40.0]

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY_SCALELENGTH

This is used to reject receptors that have non-linear baselines.  It
is the smoothing scale length in whole pixels.  Features narrower than
this are filtered out during the background-level determination.  It
should be should be odd (if an even value is supplied, the next higher
odd value will be used) and sufficiently large to remove the noise
while not removing the low-frequency patterns in the spectra.  The
minimum allowed is 51.  It is also used to detect transient non-linear
baselines (cf. LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE).  [101]

=item BASELINE_ORDER

The polynomial order to use when baselining cubes.

=item CREATE_MOMENTS_USING_SNR

If set to true (1), moments maps will be created using a
signal-to-noise map to find emission regions. This could be useful
when observations were taken under differing sky conditions and thus
have different noise levels.

=item CUBE_WCS

The coordinate system to regrid the cubes to.

=item FLATFIELD

Whether or not to perform flat-fielding.

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE

If set to true (1) the spectra for each receptor are analysed to
detect high-frequency interference noise, and those spectra deemed too
noisy are excluded from the reduced products.  [1]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_EDGE_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with high-frequency noise.  It is the
standard deviation to clip the summed-edginess profile iteratively in
order to measure the mean and standard deviation of the profile
unaffected by bad spectra.  A comma-separated list will perform
iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations in the
list should not decrease.  ["2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0"]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_THRESH_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with high-frequency noise.  This is the
number of standard deviations at which to threshold the noise profile
above its median level.  [4.0]

=item LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE

If set to true (1) the spectra for each receptor are analysed to
detect low-frequency interference ripples or bad baselines, and those
spectra deemed too deviant from linearity are excluded from the
reduced products.  [1]

=item LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE_EDGE_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with low-frequency interference.  It is the
standard deviation to clip the profile of summed-deviations from linearity
iteratively in order to measure the mean and standard deviation of the profile
unaffected by bad spectra.  A comma-separated list will perform
iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations in the
list should not decrease.  ["2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0"]

=item LOW_FREQ_INTERFERENCE_THRESH_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with low-frequency interference.  This is the
number of standard deviations at which to threshold the non-linearity profile
above its median level.  [3.0]

=item MOMENTS

A comma-separated list of moments maps to create.

=item MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY

Set a lower velocity over which the moments maps are to be
created. Typically used in conjunction with
MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY. Must include at least one decimal place
(i.e. "-50.0" for setting the limit to -50 km/s).

=item MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY

Set an upper velocity over which the moments maps are to be
created. Typically used in conjunction with
MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY. Must include at least one decimal place
(i.e. "50.0" for setting the limit to 50 km/s).

=item PIXEL_SCALE

Pixel scale, in arcseconds, of cubes.

=item REBIN

A comma-separated list of velocity resolutions to rebin the final cube
to.

=item RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this lower velocity. Must include at least one
decimal place (i.e. "-50.0" for restricting to -50 km/s).

=item RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this upper velocity. Must include at least one
decimal place (i.e. "100.0" for restricting to 100 km/s).

=item SPREAD_METHOD

The method to use when spreading each input pixel value out between a
group of neighbouring output pixels when regridding cubes. See the
SPREAD parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for available spreading methods.

=item SPREAD_WIDTH

The number of arcseconds on either side of the output position which
are to receive contributions from the input pixel. See the PARAMS
parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.

=item SPREAD_FWHM_OR_ZERO

Depending on the spreading method, this parameter controls the number
of arcseconds at which the envelope of the spreading function goes to
zero, or the full-width at half-maximum for the Gaussian envelope. See
the PARAMS parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.
