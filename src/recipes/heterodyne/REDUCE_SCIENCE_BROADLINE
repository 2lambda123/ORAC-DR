=back

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 4

=item BASELINE_EDGES

Percentage of the full range to fit on either edge of the spectra for
baselining purposes.  If set to a non-positive value and
BASELINE_REGIONS is undefined, then the baseline is derived after
smoothing and automatic emission detection.  If assigned a negative
value, BASELINE_REGIONS, if it is defined, will be used instead to
specify where to determine the baseline.  [10]

=item BASELINE_ORDER

The polynomial order to use when baselining cubes.  [1]

=item BASELINE_REGIONS

A comma-separated list of velocity ranges each in the format v1:v2,
from where the baseline should be estimated.  It is countermanded
should EDGES be defined and non-negative.   [undef]

=item CHUNKSIZE

The maximum sum of file sizes in megabytes of files to process
simultaneously in MAKECUBE to avoid a timeout.  The choice is
affected by processor speed and memory.  The minimum allowed value
is 100.  [5120]

=item CREATE_MOMENTS_USING_SNR

If set to true (1), moments maps will be created using a
signal-to-noise map to find emission regions. This could be useful
when observations were taken under differing sky conditions and thus
have different noise levels.  [0]

=item CUBE_MAXSIZE

The maximum size, in megabytes, of the output cubes. This value does not
include extra information such as variance or weight arrays, FITS
headers, or any other NDF extensions.  [512]

=item CUBE_WCS

The coordinate system to regrid the cubes to.  If undefined, the
system is determined from the data.  [undef]

=item DESPIKE

If set to 1 (true) despiking of spectra is enabled.  [0]

=item DESPIKE_BOX

The size, in pixels, of the box used to both find the "background" and
for cleaning spikes.  This box should be slightly wider than the widest
expected spike.  Making this parameter too large will result in signal
being identified as a spike and thus masked out.  [9]

=item DESPIKE_CLIP

The clip standard deviations to use when finding spikes in the
background-subtracted RMS spectrum.  Multiple values result in
multiple clip levels.  A single clip level should be given verbatim,
(e.g. 3).  If supplying more than one level, enclose comma-separated
levels within square brackets (e.g. [3,3,5]).  ['[3,5]']

=item DESPIKE_PER_DETECTOR

Whether or not to treat each detector independently during despiking.
If a spike is not seen in all detectors, consider setting this
value to 1 (for true).  [0]

=item FINAL_LOWER_VELOCITY

Set a lower velocity over which the final products, such as the
reduced and binned spectral cubes, and noise and rms images, are to be
created.  Unlike RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY, it permits the full
baselines to be used during processing, yet greatly reduces the
storage requirements of the final products by retaining only where the
astronomical signals reside.

It is typically used in conjunction with FINAL_UPPER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, there is no lower limit.  If FINAL_UPPER_VELOCITY is also
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends,
is used.  [undef]

=item FINAL_UPPER_VELOCITY

Set an upper velocity over which the final products, such as the
reduced and binned spectral cubes, and noise and rms images, are to be
created.  Unlike RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY, it permits the full
baselines to be used during processing, yet greatly reduces the
storage requirements of the final products by retaining only where the
astronomical signals reside.

It is typically used in conjunction with FINAL_LOWER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, there is no upper limit.  If FINAL_LOWER_VELOCITY is also
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends,
is used.  [undef]

=item FLATFIELD

Whether or not to perform flat-fielding.  [0]

=item FLAT_LOWER_VELOCITY

The requested lower velocity for the flat-field estimations using the
sum or ratio methods.  It should be less than FLAT_LOWER_VELOCITY.
[undef]

=item FLAT_METHOD

When flat-fielding is required (cf. FLATFIELD parameter) this selects
the method used to derive the relative gains between receptors.  The
allowed selection comprises 'ratio', which finds the histogram peaks of
the ratio of voxel values; 'sum', which finds the integrated flux; and
'index', which searches and applies a calibration index of nightly
flat-field ratios.  The ratio method ought to work well using all the data,
but for some data, especially early observations, it has broken down as
the histogram mode is biased towards zero by noise and possible non-linearity
effects.  The sum method currently assumes that every receptor is
sampling the same signal, which is only approximately true.  ['sum']

=item FLAT_UPPER_VELOCITY

The requested upper velocity for the flat-field estimations using the
the sum or ratio methods.  It should be greater than
FLAT_LOWER_VELOCITY.  [undef]

=item FRACTION_BAD

The maximum fraction of bad values permitted in a receptor (or
receptor's subband for a hybrid observation) permitted before the
a receptor is deemed to be bad.  It must lie between 0.1 and 1.0
otherwise the default fraction is substituted.  [0.9]

=item FREQUENCY_SMOOTH

The number of channels to smooth in the frequency axis when smoothing
to determine baselines.  This number should be small (~10) for
narrow-line observations and large (~25) for broad-line
observations.  [25]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE

If set to true (1) the spectra for each receptor are analysed to
detect high-frequency interference noise, and those spectra deemed too
noisy are excluded from the reduced products.  [1]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_EDGE_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with high-frequency noise.  It is the
standard deviation to clip the summed-edginess profile iteratively in
order to measure the mean and standard deviation of the profile
unaffected by bad spectra.  A comma-separated list will perform
iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations in the
list should not decrease.  ["2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0"]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_THRESH_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with high-frequency noise.  This is the
number of standard deviations at which to threshold the noise profile
above its median level.  [4.0]

=item HIGHFREQ_RINGING

Whether or not to test for high-frequency ringing in the spectra. This
is where a band of spectra in the time series have the same
oscillation frequency and origin with smoothly varying amplitude over
time.  The amplitude is an order of magnitude or more lower than the
regular high-frequency interference, but because it extends over tens
to over 200 spectra, its affect can be as potent.

Even if set to 1 (true), at least HIGHFREQ_RINGING_MIN_SPECTRA
spectra are required to give a sufficient baseline against which to
detect spectra with ringing.  The HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE parameter
must be true to apply this filter.  [0]

=item HIGHFREQ_RINGING_MIN_SPECTRA

Minimum number of good spectra for ringing filtering to be attempted.
See HIGHFREQ_RINGING.  The filter needs to be able to discriminate
between the normal unaffected spectra from those with ringing.  The
value should be at least a few times larger than the number of
affected spectra.  Hence there is a minimum allowed value of 100.  The
default is an empirical guess; for the worst cases it will be too
small.  If there are insufficient spectra the filtering may still work
to some degree.  [400]

=item LV_AXIS

The axis to collapse in the cube to form the LV image.  Can be the
axis's index or its generic "skylat" or "skylon".  ["skylat"]

=item LV_ESTIMATOR

The statistic to use to collapse the spatial axis to form the LV image.
See the KAPPA:COLLAPSE:ESTIMATOR documentation for a list of allowed
statistics.  ["mean"]

=item LV_IMAGE

A longitude-velocity map is made from the reduced group cube, if this
parameter is set to true (1).  The longitude here carries its generic
meaning, so it could equally well be right ascension or galactic
longitude; the actual axis derives from the chosen co-ordinate system
(see CUBE_WCS).  [undef]

=item MOMENTS

A comma-separated list of moments maps to create.  ["integ,iwc"]

=item MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY

Set a lower velocity over which the moments maps are to be created.
It is typically used in conjunction with MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is
used.  [undef]

=item MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY

Set an upper velocity over which the moments maps are to be created.
It is typically used in conjunction with MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is
used.  [undef]

=item PIXEL_SCALE

Pixel scale, in arcseconds, of cubes.  If undefined it is determined
from the data.  [undef]

=item REBIN

A comma-separated list of velocity resolutions to rebin the final cube
to.  If undefined, the observed resolution is used.  [undef]

=item RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this lower velocity.  It is typically used in
conjunction with RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY.  If undefined, the full
velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is used.  [undef]

=item RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this upper velocity.  It is typically used in
conjunction with RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY.  If undefined, the full
velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is used.  [undef]

=item SPATIAL_SMOOTH

The number of pixels to smooth in both spatial axes when smoothing to
determine baselines.  [3]

=item SPREAD_FWHM_OR_ZERO

Depending on the spreading method, this parameter controls the number
of arcseconds at which the envelope of the spreading function goes to
zero, or the full-width at half-maximum for the Gaussian envelope. See
the PARAMS parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.  [undef]

=item SPREAD_METHOD

The method to use when spreading each input pixel value out between a
group of neighbouring output pixels when regridding cubes. See the
SPREAD parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for available spreading methods.
["nearest"]

=item SPREAD_WIDTH

The number of arcseconds on either side of the output position which
are to receive contributions from the input pixel. See the PARAMS
parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.  [0]

=item TILE

Whether or not to make tiled spectral cubes.  A true value (1)
performs tiling so as to restrict the data-processing resource
requirements.  Such tiled cubes abut each other in pixel co-ordinates
and may be pasted together to form the complete spectral cube.  [1]

=item TRIM_MINIMUM_OVERLAP

The minimum number of desired channels that should overlap after
trimming hybrid-mode observations.  If the number of overlapping
channels is fewer than this, then the fixed number of channels will be
trimmed according to the C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE>, C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE_LOWER>,
and C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE_UPPER> parameters.  [10]

=item TRIM_PERCENTAGE_LOWER = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from the lower end
of the frequency range.  For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency
channels, and the percentage to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be
trimmed from the lower end.  If it and C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE> are
undefined, the lower-end trimming defaults to 2.75% for ACSIS and 7.5%
for DAS observations.  [undef]

=item TRIM_PERCENTAGE = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from either end.
For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency channels, and the percentage
to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be trimmed from either end.
This parameter only takes effect if both C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE_LOWER> and
C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE_UPPER> are undefined.  If it too is undefined,
the upper-frequency trimming defaults to 2.75% for ACSIS and 7.5% for
DAS observations.  [undef]

=item TRIM_PERCENTAGE_UPPER = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from the higher
end of the frequency range. For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency
channels, and the percentage to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be
trimmed from the upper end.  If it and C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE> are undefined,
it defaults to 2.75% for ACSIS and 7.5% for DAS observations.  [undef]

=item VELOCITY_BIN_FACTOR

This is an integer factor by which the spectral axis may be compressed
by averaging adjacent channels. The rationale is to make the reduced
spectral cubes files substantially smaller; processing much faster;
and to reduce the noise so that, for example, emission features are
more easily identified and masked while determining the baselines.  It
is intended for ACSIS modes, such as BW250, possessing high spectral
resolution not warranted by the signal-to-noise.

Note that this compression is applied after any filtering of
high-frequency artefacts performed on adjacent channels.

A typical factor is 4.  There is no compression if this parameter is
undefined.  [undef]
