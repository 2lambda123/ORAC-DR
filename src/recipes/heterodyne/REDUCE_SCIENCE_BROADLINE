=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 4

=item BASELINE_EDGES

Percentage of the full range to fit on either edge of the spectra for
baselining purposes.  If set to a non-positive value and
BASELINE_REGIONS is undefined, then the baseline is derived after
smoothing and automatic emission detection.  If assigned a negative
value, BASELINE_REGIONS, if it is defined, will be used instead to
specify where to determine the baseline.  [10]

=item BASELINE_ORDER

The polynomial order to use when baselining cubes.  [1]

=item BASELINE_REGIONS

A comma-separated list of velocity ranges each in the format v1:v2,
from where the baseline should be estimated.  It is countermanded
should EDGES be defined and non-negative.   [undef]

=item CREATE_MOMENTS_USING_SNR

If set to true (1), moments maps will be created using a
signal-to-noise map to find emission regions. This could be useful
when observations were taken under differing sky conditions and thus
have different noise levels.  [0]

=item CUBE_WCS

The coordinate system to regrid the cubes to.  If undefined, the
system is determined from the data.  [undef]

=item FLATFIELD

Whether or not to perform flat-fielding.  [0]

=item FREQUENCY_SMOOTH

The number of channels to smooth in the frequency axis when smoothing
to determine baselines.  This number should be small (~10) for
narrow-line observations and large (~25) for broad-line
observations.  [25]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE

If set to true (1) the spectra for each receptor are analysed to
detect high-frequency interference noise, and those spectra deemed too
noisy are excluded from the reduced products.  [1]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_EDGE_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with high-frequency noise.  It is the
standard deviation to clip the summed-edginess profile iteratively in
order to measure the mean and standard deviation of the profile
unaffected by bad spectra.  A comma-separated list will perform
iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations in the
list should not decrease.  ["2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0"]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_THRESH_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with high-frequency noise.  This is the
number of standard deviations at which to threshold the noise profile
above its median level.  [4.0]

=item HIGHFREQ_RINGING

Whether or not to test for high-frequency ringing in the spectra. This
is where a band of spectra in the time series have the same
oscillation frequency and origin with smoothly varying amplitude over
time.  The amplitude is an order of magnitude or more lower than the
regular high-frequency interference, but because it extends over tens
to over 200 spectra, its affect can be as potent.

Even if set to 1 (true), at least HIGHFREQ_RINGING_MIN_SPECTRA
spectra are required to give a sufficient baseline against which to
detect spectra with ringing.  The HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE parameter
must be true to apply this filter.  [0]

=item HIGHFREQ_RINGING_MIN_SPECTRA

Minimum number of good spectra for ringing filtering to be attempted.
See HIGHFREQ_RINGING.  The filter needs to be able to discriminate
between the normal unaffected spectra from those with ringing.  The
value should be at least a few times larger than the number of
affected spectra.  Hence there is a minimum allowed value of 100.  The
default is an empirical guess; for the worst cases it will be too
small.  If there are insufficient spectra the filtering may still work
to some degree.  [400]

=item MOMENTS

A comma-separated list of moments maps to create.  ["integ,iwc"]

=item MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY

Set a lower velocity over which the moments maps are to be created.
It is typically used in conjunction with MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is
used.  [undef]

=item MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY

Set an upper velocity over which the moments maps are to be created.
It is typically used in conjunction with MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is
used.  [undef]

=item PIXEL_SCALE

Pixel scale, in arcseconds, of cubes.  If undefined it is determined
from the data.  [undef]

=item REBIN

A comma-separated list of velocity resolutions to rebin the final cube
to.  If undefined, the observed resolution is used.  [undef]

=item RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this lower velocity.  It is typically used in
conjunction with RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY.  If undefined, the full
velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is used.  [undef]

=item RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this upper velocity.  It is typically used in
conjunction with RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY.  If undefined, the full
velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is used.  [undef]

=item SPATIAL_SMOOTH

The number of pixels to smooth in both spatial axes when smoothing to
determine baselines.  [3]

=item SPREAD_FWHM_OR_ZERO

Depending on the spreading method, this parameter controls the number
of arcseconds at which the envelope of the spreading function goes to
zero, or the full-width at half-maximum for the Gaussian envelope. See
the PARAMS parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.  [undef]

=item SPREAD_METHOD

The method to use when spreading each input pixel value out between a
group of neighbouring output pixels when regridding cubes. See the
SPREAD parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for available spreading methods.
["nearest"]

=item SPREAD_WIDTH

The number of arcseconds on either side of the output position which
are to receive contributions from the input pixel. See the PARAMS
parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.  [0]

=item TRIM_PERCENTAGE_LOWER = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from the lower end
of the frequency range.  For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency
channels, and the percentage to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be
trimmed from the lower end.  If it and C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE> are
undefined, the lower-end trimming defaults to 2.75% for ACSIS and 7.5%
for DAS observations.  [undef]

=item TRIM_PERCENTAGE = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from either end.
For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency channels, and the percentage
to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be trimmed from either end.
This parameter only takes effect if both C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE_LOWER> and
C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE_UPPER> are undefined.  If it too is undefined,
the upper-frequency trimming defaults to 2.75% for ACSIS and 7.5% for
DAS observations.  [undef]

=item TRIM_PERCENTAGE_UPPER = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from the higher
end of the frequency range. For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency
channels, and the percentage to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be
trimmed from the upper end.  If it and C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE> are undefined,
it defaults to 2.75% for ACSIS and 7.5% for DAS observations.  [undef]
