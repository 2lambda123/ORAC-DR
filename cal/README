ORAC-DR Calibration files
=========================

This directory contains the calibration files required to run
the ORAC-DR pipeline. There is a directory for each instrument.

In general this directory should be set using the ORAC_CAL_ROOT
environment variable. Once set, the oracdr initialisation scripts
will configure the pipeline to correctly pick up the specific 
calibration files.

Use ORAC_DATA_CAL environment variable to explicitly choose a
calibration directory.
