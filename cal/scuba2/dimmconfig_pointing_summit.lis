# Special configuration for pointing & focus observations in the SUMMIT pipeline
^$STARLINK_DIR/share/smurf/dimmconfig_pointing.lis

# Reduce the number of iterations - the maps won't converge using the
# new map-based convergence criteria, but they will be good enough for
# pointing and focus measurements. Testing shows that 10 iterations
# yields fluxes (and hence FCFs) closer to the "real" value (using the
# full number of iterations) than 5, and the pipeline is fast enough
# to use 10.
